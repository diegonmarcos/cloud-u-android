# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, in the owner's words: "why GitHub Apps??? it is just a Git
# Auth to get its ssh key!!!" He was right, and #641 finished the argument: the
# provider is DELETED, not documented.
#
# ON THE PROVIDER SIDE the browser road was never open. The declared client was a
# GitHub APP (the client_id prefix GitHub gives App clients) and GitHub Apps ship
# with Device Flow OFF, so every press of Start answered `device_flow_disabled -
# Device Flow must be explicitly enabled for this App`. That is a switch in the
# provider's own settings and NO code can reach it, so after the owner hit it a
# third time the provider and its two remedy rows were removed. A browser git
# login would need a GitHub OAuth App — a different kind of app, which does not
# exist yet — so there is NO fallback: the vault credential is the only git auth.
#
# ON OUR SIDE the credential was already on the phone. cloud-vault
# C_A1-configs/git/sources.json declares git.github_token (and an ssh key pair),
# the #566 emitter really does put it in the artifact, and #608's DriveAuthApply
# already writes it into libs:git-sync's keystore credential store. The browser
# ceremony was duplicating a credential we had — and adding a provider setting as
# a single point of failure on top of it.
#
#   A1  the vault credential is READ, from the engines' own store under the
#       DECLARED credential_id, and the listing runs off it with no tap.
#   A2  a vault import writes it even when NOTHING is cloned yet — the fresh-phone
#       case, where the old plan() reported not-ok and threw the token away.
#   A3  #641 INVERTED: there is NO browser grant on the page at all — no sign-in
#       surface, no Start button, no provider named — and the credential-absent
#       line says so in its own words, with no breadcrumb to another page.
#   A4  there is no second credential store: the token goes into, and comes out
#       of, libs:git-sync's GitCredentialStore and nowhere else.
#   R1  #641 INVERTED: the grant_remedies MECHANISM stays declared in one place
#       (ab_cloud-libs-shared/build.json::auth.grant_remedies) with libs:auth as
#       its single consumer, and the two rows that existed only to word the
#       GitHub App's dead end are gone, as is the provider itself.
#   MUT mutation-proof: a credential resolved from somewhere other than the
#       vault-delivered config, a sign-in surface put back on the page, the
#       github provider re-declared and an emptied remedy table each go RED.
