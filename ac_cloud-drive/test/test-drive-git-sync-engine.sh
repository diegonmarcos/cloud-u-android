# ║ #567 push 2 — libs:git-sync is a FULL git manager: every verb the brief  ║
# ║ names exists on the engine, is reached from the screen, is proven by a  ║
# ║ JVM test, and branches stay read-only                                    ║
# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. #871 move 11: JGit and the verbs' behaviour on real repositories moved to
# libs:git-sync-engine (Cloud-Lib-Git-Sync-Engine.apk); their checks (the engine proper is pure JVM,
# branches are read-only in JGit, JGitEngineTest names every verb, the jsch wiring, the session leg)
# moved to ab_cloud-libs-shared/lib-apks/test/test-git-sync-engine.sh. What only a tester over THIS
# app's module can see is the SHAPE of the client the manager screen is written against:
# whether the manager screen actually reaches each verb (an engine verb no button calls is a feature
# that does not exist on the phone), whether the client stays Android-free (an android.* import in
# GitEngine.kt makes the JVM suite untestable and silently mocked), and whether the read-only branch
# rule holds at the source level as well as the API level.
#
#   G1  the brief's verb inventory — status, stage, unstage, commit, push, pull, branches, log, diff,
#       remotes, and the conflict surface's three verbs resolve / markResolved / abortMerge — is DECLARED
#       on GitEngine (a `fun <verb>(` in GitEngine.kt) …
#   G2  … and REACHED from GitSyncScreen.kt (a `.<verb>(` call), both ends;
#       and the conflict LIST itself (status().conflicts, the one snapshot) is
#       rendered by the screen.
#   G3  GitEngine.kt imports nothing from android.* — it is the JVM-tested half.
#   G4  branches are read-only: no create/delete/checkout/rename-branch verb on the client, and no
#       JGit anywhere in the module (the app compiles none).
#   G5  the client's JVM suite exists and covers every verb in G1 by name.
#
# OWN-SOURCE ONLY: everything read here is under a module dir this app's
# build.json declares, so the engine judges the verdict as this app's own.
