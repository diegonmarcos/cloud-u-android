# ║ #567 push 4 / #871 move 10 — Cloud Drive uses rclone through the ENGINE,  ║
# ║ and carries neither the binary nor its packaging                         ║
# ╚═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# The parsers, stores and the runner's handling of the engine's answers are proven by
# RcloneEngineTest and RcloneRunnerTest in every drive ship. The pinned binary, its fetch and
# its exec moved to libs:rclone-engine (Cloud-Lib-Rclone-Engine.apk); their checks moved to
# ab_cloud-libs-shared/lib-apks/test/test-rclone-engine.sh. What only a tester over the build
# files can see, here:
#
#   R1  the app does not extract native libs for a binary it no longer carries
#       (no useLegacyPackaging in app/build.gradle), and does not declare the engine's module.
#   R2  the client reaches the engine, not a process: RcloneRunner is built on the transport,
#       the module execs nothing, and the screen says what to install when the engine is absent.
#   R4  the remote-types catalogue is one named asset, opened by the screen and
#       read by the JVM test; the job store's declare() is what the host calls.
#   R5  the pure half imports nothing from android.*.
#
# OWN-SOURCE ONLY: everything read is under this app or a module dir its
# build.json declares.
