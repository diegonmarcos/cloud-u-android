# ║ #621 — the app's DENSITY comes from ONE declaration (DriveMetrics) and   ║
# ║ no screen sizes itself: dense data, not launcher chrome                  ║
# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. "this app UI should fully scale down we are dense data here!
# this fucking huge buttons!!!" — and the reason it got that way is structural,
# not aesthetic: sixteen Compose files each carried their own dp literals, so a
# density decision was never made once, it was made ~120 times. Gradle compiles
# any number of them, and a screenshot of ONE screen looks fine while the next
# screen is a third looser. The defect this pins is therefore not "the rows are
# tall", it is "the app has no single density knob" — and the only way that stays
# true is if a new dp typed into a screen turns the build RED.
#
#   T1  the declaration EXISTS and is dense: DriveMetrics carries the density
#       vocabulary, rowHeight <= 40dp, islandHeight <= 48dp, cardPadding <= 8dp,
#       and the six-step spacing set is monotone (hairline<tight<gap<gapWide<pad<padWide).
#   T2  ONE source: no Kotlin file under app/src/main outside Chrome.kt holds a
#       dp OR sp literal of its own — every size is a DriveMetrics member.
#   T3  every screen READS it: the five tabs (Files, Volumes, Home, Sync, Configs),
#       #608's Git page, #613's Volumes sections, the dialogs, the Apps grid and
#       the chrome itself all reference DriveMetrics, so one edit moves them together.
#   T4  the TYPE scale is scaled once, in the theme (MaterialTheme typography =
#       denseTypography(), DriveMetrics.textScale < 1) — not with a fontSize per Text.
#   T5  touch targets stay usable: tap >= 36dp, and every IconButton in the app
#       is sized from the declaration rather than Material's 48dp default.
#   T6  #603 is not regressed by the theme edit: DriveTheme still provides
#       LocalContentColor, so dark-theme text is not black.
#   M   mutation-proof: a magic dp put back into a screen, a screen that stops
#       reading the declaration, a launcher-sized rowHeight, a dropped dense
#       typography and a dropped LocalContentColor each turn a check RED; the
#       unmutated tree stays green.
#
# OWN-SOURCE ONLY. python3 and grep only.
