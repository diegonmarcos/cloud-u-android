# WHY THIS EXISTS. #577: the reader was pdf.js in a WebView — one page on one canvas, the whole
# file base64'd across the bridge, a 24 MB ceiling — and was replaced by a native reader on pdfium
# (io.legere:pdfiumandroid). Gradle cannot see most of what makes that replacement true: a feature
# that is written but never reachable from the toolbar, a second engine creeping back in beside the
# first (#463), the pdf.js files still riding in the APK, the manifest still routing "Open with" to
# the old activity. Those are STRINGS and WIRING, so they are checked here as facts about the source.
#
# What is NOT here is behaviour that can be executed: the converter and the page layout are pure
# Kotlin, and app/src/test (PdfConvertTest, PdfLayoutTest) runs them on every ship through
# build.json::tests.unit. This file only holds the pieces that need a device or an emulator to run
# for real — drawing, gestures, the pdfium native calls — to their wiring, and says so. STILL NOT
# COVERED: that a page actually renders sharp at 6x, that a fling feels smooth, that pdfium opens a
# given hostile file. Those need a phone.
#
# NO RIPGREP: grep and python3 only, both in build.json::tests.shell.requires. A missing SOURCE file
# is fatal here, so a renamed file cannot turn the assertions below into a silent no-op.
