# ║ #608 — SYNC ▸ GIT is DECLARED and DENSE: two sections from build.json,    ║
# ║ a public set that is really public, a login that reuses the fleet's ONE  ║
# ║ sign-in for the `repo` scope, fourteen per-repository operations that     ║
# ║ every one reach libs:git-sync, and clones that land in the store's git    ║
# ║ folder — never a second git, never a second list, never a big card       ║
# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Gradle proves the page compiles. It cannot see that an
# operation the declaration promises has no handler (a button that does
# nothing), that a handler exists for an operation nobody declared (a verb with
# no label), that the "public" set contains a repository the API calls private
# (a clone that fails forever), that the listing endpoint was typed into Kotlin
# beside the declaration, that the force verbs quietly became synonyms for the
# plain ones, or that the "dense row" is a card again. This file can.
#
#   P1  the declaration is whole and ordered: ui.sync.git carries the two
#       sections (public, personal), the personal split (Public, Private), a
#       WebAuth way and an SSH way, an https api with {owner}/{name} in its web
#       url, the three remote modes with read-only marked, fourteen operations
#       including the six transport/commit verbs and the two DESTRUCTIVE ones,
#       an owner, the name families and a non-empty public set.
#   P2  the public set is derived, not hand-picked: every name begins with a
#       declared name family, the list is unique and alphabetical, THIS
#       repository (cloud-u-android) is in it, every repository the seed
#       manifest marks `seed` is in it, and nothing the manifest marks
#       `private: true` is.
#   P3  declaration ↔ dispatch, both directions: GitReposScreen's
#       `when (section.id)` is exactly the declared section ids, and its
#       `when (op.id)` is exactly the declared operation ids.
#   P4  every git verb is the ENGINE's: the coordinator's `when (opId)` calls
#       e.fetch / e.pull / e.commit / e.push / e.forcePush / e.forcePull,
#       GitEngine declares the two force verbs, the JVM suite EXERCISES them
#       (and proves the plain verbs refuse the same divergence first), and the
#       app still imports no JGit.
#   P5  #641 INVERTED: there is NO browser login on this page. No sign-in
#       surface, no webauth way, no GitHub App client id in either declaration,
#       exactly ONE device grant left in the shared declaration (Google's) and
#       no breadcrumb prose; the SSH way reuses the key path the per-repo sheet
#       already holds, and no token is logged or persisted here.
#   P6  the listing comes from the declaration: no endpoint literal in the
#       page's sources, the parser is pure and JVM-tested, and the two groups
#       are the PROVIDER's own `private` flag, each alphabetical.
#   P7  the reads are real reads: hooks = .git/hooks minus *.sample, workflows =
#       .github/workflows/*.y(a)ml, size walks the tree without following a
#       symlink, all three JVM-tested by name.
#   P8  DENSE: the repository row is a Row with a height floor and a status DOT,
#       NOT a DriveCard; the operations rail lives behind the row's expand
#       disclosure; and the clone lands in SharedStore.repoDir.
#   M   mutation-proof: an operation dropped from the declaration → P3 red; a
#       section id misspelt in the screen → P3 red; a private repository added
#       to the public set → P2 red; forcePush removed from the engine → P4 red;
#       the unmutated tree stays green.
#
# OWN-SOURCE ONLY: everything read here is under this app or a module dir its
# build.json declares. python3 and grep only.
