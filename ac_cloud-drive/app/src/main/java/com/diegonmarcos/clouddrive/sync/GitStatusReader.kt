/**
 * #850 THE ONE STATUS READER of the Sync ▸ Git page (and of /api/git/status).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Before it, GitSyncCoordinator.refresh() read EVERY repository's
 * `git status` serially inside ONE withContext block and published the glances only
 * when ALL of them had returned, with no bound. One clone whose status never returns
 * (a large working tree on the FUSE-backed shared storage, where JGit re-hashes every
 * file whose stat it cannot trust, or a held lock) therefore left every row on
 * "reading…" for ever — the map the rows read was never written. Each refresh() also
 * started a second full serial pass beside the first, so ops and re-entries stacked
 * readers on the same trees.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT, each clause tested by GitStatusReaderTest:
 *  - BOUNDED: every probe runs on its own daemon thread and is awaited for at most
 *    [timeoutMs]; past it the repository is ERROR("timeout …") — a terminal state.
 *  - OFF THE MAIN THREAD: probes run on dedicated threads, the waits on [scope].
 *  - PER REPOSITORY, LIMITED CONCURRENCY: at most [concurrency] probes are awaited at
 *    once and each publishes its own entry the moment it ends, so a large repository
 *    never holds the others back.
 *  - CACHED WITH A TIMESTAMP: an entry younger than [ttlMs] is not re-read unless forced.
 *  - NEVER RESTARTED: a repository with a probe in flight — or one still stuck past
 *    its timeout — is never probed again until that probe returns, however often the
 *    page recomposes or asks.
 *  - ALWAYS ENDS in CLEAN / AHEAD / BEHIND / DIRTY / NOT_CLONED / ERROR(reason).
