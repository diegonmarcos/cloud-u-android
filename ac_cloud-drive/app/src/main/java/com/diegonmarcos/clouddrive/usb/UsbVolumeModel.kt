/**
 * #1375 USB-C drives, the PURE part: no Android, no IO, so the JVM suite (UsbVolumeModelTest) proves every
 * rule and drive-usb-mutation.yml proves the suite catches a break in each one.
 *
 * Two ways a drive reaches Cloud Drive:
 *  1. Android mounts it (most phones do for FAT32/exFAT, some for NTFS): it is a StorageVolume, read by
 *     [StorageVolumes] into [Volume] rows, mapped here into Explorer places with a label and a size.
 *  2. Android does not mount it: the raw USB device (mass-storage class 8) is opened by libaums
 *     ([RawUsbDrive], FAT32) after the per-device USB permission (libs:perms PermsUsb).
