/**
 * #629 WHAT THE FIRST-RUN SEED DID, per repository — the part that was missing and that made a
 * truncated store look like a finished one.
 *
 * The defect this exists for: [StoreSeedWorker] logged a failure with `Log.w` and carried on, and
 * then returned `Result.success()` whatever the tally was. WorkManager's execution window is ten
 * minutes; twelve shallow clones do not fit it, so the worker was stopped mid-clone, every
 * remaining repository failed instantly against the torn-down thread, and the unique work ended
 * TERMINALLY GREEN with nine of twelve repositories present — the exact measured state of the
 * owner's device, missing the alphabetical tail.
 *
 * So the pass is now a REPORT: one [SeedOutcome] per DECLARED repository (no repository is ever
 * absent from it — a silent skip is impossible by construction), [complete] is the honest verdict,
 * and the worker turns "not complete" into `Result.retry()` so the tail is resumed instead of
 * being lost. Pure Kotlin, no Android: SeedReportTest runs it on the JVM.
