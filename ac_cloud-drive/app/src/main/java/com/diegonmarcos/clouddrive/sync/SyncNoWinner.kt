/**
 * SYNC-NO-WINNER's PURE RULES (JVM-tested in SyncNoWinnerTest).
 *
 * "No winner" = neither side is preferred: fetch the upstream and MERGE it into the local branch. It succeeds only when
 * git can combine both histories without a conflict; when it cannot, nothing is changed and the owner picks a side
 * (remote wins / local wins) or resolves by hand. So a failure must say WHY, never a bare "not merged".
 *
 * IDENTITY (same one-clone rule as [BulkDepth]): a clone is the canonical registry repository of its ORIGIN URL, the
 * renamed_from chains folded in; with no origin, of its folder name. A clone under an OLD name is that repository under its
 * current name; when a clone under the current name already exists, the old-named one is a stale duplicate and is not merged.
