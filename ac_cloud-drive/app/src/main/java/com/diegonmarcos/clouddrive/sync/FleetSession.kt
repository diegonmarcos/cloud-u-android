/**
 * #653 THE FLEET SESSION, IN MEMORY AND NOWHERE ELSE.
 *
 * What the owner's Authelia browser login earns is a session cookie. This app needs it
 * for exactly one purpose — presenting it to git-proxy-api so the GitHub work happens on
 * the server — and it must not survive beyond the process.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AN OBJECT WITH A VAR AND NOT A STORE. There is deliberately no
 * SharedPreferences, no EncryptedSharedPreferences, no file and no keystore entry here.
 * `test-drive-configs-sign-in.sh` asserts that the drive host stores no bearer, and that
 * guard enforces the owner's standing rule that the phone does not persist a credential
 * it did not have to. A process-lifetime field satisfies it by construction rather than by
 * promise: there is no code path that could write this value anywhere, because there is no
 * writer. Killing the app forgets it and the owner signs in again — which is the correct
 * trade for a credential that authorises reading a private repository list.
 *
 * NOTE WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a GitHub credential and cannot become one. It proves
 * the owner's identity TO THE FLEET; the GitHub token stays on the server, which is the
 * whole point of ranking the fleet rung first. The one GitHub credential this app may
 * hold is the vault import's, and that lives in libs:git-sync's own store under the one
 * declared id — never here.
