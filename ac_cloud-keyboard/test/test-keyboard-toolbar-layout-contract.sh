# WHY THIS LIVES HERE. The same contract is asserted by
# aa_cloud-superapp/test/test-keyboard-toolbar-paging.sh — and that tester gates
# the SUPERAPP's release, not this one. cloud-keyboard ships libs:keyboard as its
# own APK, so until this file existed the toolbar could regress and every gate on
# THIS app stayed green. build.json::tests._doc already records that trap for the
# app as a whole; this is the toolbar's share of it.
#
# WHAT IT PINS, and every one of these has actually shipped broken:
#
#   A1  the page size is DERIVED from live measurements — the viewport divided by
#       a real key's width. A literal "11 per page" would be right on exactly one
#       screen and silently wrong on every other width, rotation and icon size.
#   A2  every toolbar key carries its OWN page gap. ONE SHARED gap (once, one
#       LinearLayout.LayoutParams object) is the four-icons-instead-of-eleven bug
#       (#319, fixed in 59527a722): the margin written for the one key that
#       starts its own page landed on every key. The strip takes one gap PER KEY
#       from ToolbarPaging.gaps.
#   A3  the geometry, computed from the SHIPPED key width and the REAL default
#       row, laid out the way the strip does — and laid out through whichever
#       gap model A2 found in the source, so the pre-fix state produces the
#       decaying row it really produced instead of the design's split.
#   A4  exactly one place computes the page-start gap of a toolbar key. Two
#       writers cannot converge on a page boundary.
#
# NO RIPGREP, DELIBERATELY: testers in this repository have passed on its absence
# rather than on their assertions. grep, awk and python3 only — all three are
# build.json::tests.shell.requires, so a missing one is fatal at the preflight
# instead of quietly agreeing with everything here. A missing SOURCE file is
# fatal here too, for the same reason: every assertion below would read an empty
# file and pass.

# CLOUD_ANDROID_ROOT is the test engine's own variable for "the checkout to read",
