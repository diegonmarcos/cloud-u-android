# ║ The Text tools resolve WHICH app serves them, and leak no key    ║
# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The Text tools (Enhance, Translate, Grammar, Resume) are
# moving out of the keyboard and into cloud-writer, the application the owner
# asked for. The move is made survivable by ONE property: the client resolves
# the serving application from an ordered preference list at every bind instead
# of holding a single hardcoded package name.
#
# Every assertion below guards a way that property can be silently undone, and
# each failure is silent in exactly the way that matters — nothing crashes, the
# owner just finds that a tool stopped working, or worse that it kept working
# while pointing at the wrong app.
#
#   T1/T2  the list exists and cloud-writer is BEFORE cloud-keyboard. Reverse
#          them and cloud-writer can be installed on the phone while every
#          consumer keeps talking to the keyboard, with nothing on screen saying
#          so. Order is the entire meaning of the list.
#   T3     no single-address constant survives. A leftover SERVICE_PKG is a
#          caller that never moves, and it would move on the day the keyboard
#          stops serving — i.e. it would break in the field, not in CI.
#   T4     the bind uses the RESOLVED package, not a constant. This is the
#          difference between "the fallback works" and "the fallback is written
#          down in a comment".
#   T5     resolution walks the list in order and filters by what actually
#          publishes the action, so an uninstalled preferred app is skipped
#          rather than bound-and-failed.
#   T6     isServingAppInstalled answers for ANY entry. Answering only for the
#          head would report a phone with a working Cloud Keyboard as having no
#          text tools and send the owner to install something that changes
#          nothing.
#   T7     <queries> stays scoped to the ACTION and names no package. A
#          package-scoped query grants visibility of that package only, so
#          cloud-writer would be invisible to resolution however the list reads.
#   T8     NO CONSUMER HARD-DEPENDS ON cloud-writer. The standing fleet rule is
#          that nothing outside an application's own source may fail that
#          application's release; a consumer manifest naming cloud-writer's
#          package would break that at install time.
#   T9/T10 no token reaches a log. This fleet ships a diagnostics path that
#          reads logcat and uploads it, so a key in the log is a key off the
#          phone. revealAiKey's result must never be logged, and the one catch
#          block that runs while a secret is in hand must log a class name and
#          not the exception.
#
# The assertions are STRUCTURAL — which call sits inside which function body —
# because that structure IS the fix. A wording check would pass over a rewrite
# that puts the defect straight back.
#
# No ripgrep, deliberately: four testers in this repository once passed only
# because ripgrep was absent and their call failed open. awk and grep only, and
# a missing file is FATAL rather than an empty read every assertion agrees with.
