 * The navigation declaration app/build.gradle bakes from build.json::ui (bottom_nav, sections, default_section),
 * decoded once through libs:bottomnav's NavDecl. Kotlin names no section label: the bottom nav, the second
 * row and the title dropdown all come from it. The SI section's pages are the personas of assets/si/personas.json and
 * the News section's pages are the topics of assets/si/news.json: their ids are data, declared in build.json::ui
 * too (test-superintel-app.sh holds the three in step), so Kotlin names none of them.
