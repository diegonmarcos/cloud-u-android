/**
 * Where the destinations of the retired Cloud Me layout went, so a saved state, a SuperApp tile or a shortcut written
 * against the old ids still lands somewhere sensible instead of nowhere. The Work section is now LLC (Employed kept,
 * Endeavours became Side hustles); House is gone and its household bills, inventory and upkeep belong to Buro > Docs
 * (Assets, Services, Liabilities & Taxes); Profile > Tasks moved to its own Duties section; Buro's old Docs, Fin and
 * Summary pages became the Buro groups. Old stores held no user entries (Work and House were generated or empty pages),
 * so routes are the whole migration of the navigation; the Work pages' content moved with its generator (data/regen-study.py).
