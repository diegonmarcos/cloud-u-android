// cloud-code — THE SEAM (#562). Diego: "FOCUS ON UI AND SMALL ENGINES".
//
// Every data source the Agents / Repos / Home tabs need that is NOT a small
// on-device engine lives behind one of these functions, and nowhere else. The UI
// only ever calls them, so replacing a stub with a real provider (the agent
// runner's API, gitea, cloud-myterminal's workspace broker) is a change to this
// file alone. Each stub is marked `SEAM:` and says what it would call; the
// tester counts the markers against the exports so a new seam cannot land
// unmarked.

import fsOperation from "fileSystem";

// SEAM: agents — the LIVE half only: running status and token utilisation from
// the agent runner (my-ai claude-api, mesh-only). Assignment, model and batch
// are NOT this seam's: the backlog dist already derives them, and the tab
// renders that view (nav.json::agents.entry). Stub: an empty list plus the
// reason, which the tab shows under the view as-is.

	return {
		stub: true,
		items: [],
		note: "Live status and token use: agent runner not wired yet (#562). Assignments above come from the backlog.",

// SEAM: repos — a small real engine for now: the children of the declared root
// that hold a .git directory. Replace with gitea / the workspace broker.

// renders one card per other tab from nav.json, which needs no provider.
