This repository is Acode Foundation's standalone fork. Its primary change is
support for attaching multiple independent LSP clients to one CodeMirror
`EditorView`.

Keep upstream imports and Acode changes in separate commits when practical.

To sync a release:

1. Download or clone the new upstream version into a temporary directory.
2. Diff its `src`, `test`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, and
   `package.json` against this directory.
3. Apply upstream-only changes first, keeping this package's local metadata and
   the multi-client changes described in the Acode changelog.
4. Run Acode's typecheck, `tests/unit/lspMultiClient.test.js`, full unit suite,
   and production build.

Keep the canonical repository configured as the `upstream` remote:

```shell
git remote add upstream https://code.haverbeke.berlin/codemirror/lsp-client.git
git fetch upstream --tags
```

Acode consumes an exact commit of this repository through its package
manifest. After publishing a new fork commit, update that commit hash in
Acode's `package.json` and lockfiles.
