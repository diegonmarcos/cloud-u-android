This package implements a language server protocol (LSP) client for
the [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) code editor.

The [project page](https://codemirror.net/) has more information, a
number of [examples](https://codemirror.net/examples/) and the
[documentation](https://codemirror.net/docs/ref/#lsp-client).

This code is released under an
[MIT license](https://code.haverbeke.berlin/codemirror/lsp-client/tree/main/LICENSE).

We aim to be an inclusive, welcoming community. To make that explicit,
we have a [code of
conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/1/0/) that applies
to communication around the project.

## Usage

There are various ways to run a language server and connect it to a
web page. You can run it on the server and proxy it through a web
socket, or, if it is written in JavaScript or can be compiled to WASM,
run it directly in the client. The @codemirror/lsp-client package
talks to the server through a ([`Transport`](#lsp-client.Transport))
object, which exposes a small interface for sending and receiving JSON
messages.

Responsibility for how to actually talk to the server, how to connect
and to handle disconnects are left to the code that implements the
transport.

## Multiple servers per editor (Acode fork)

This Acode Foundation fork allows several independent clients to attach to the
same `EditorView`. For example, TypeScript can be the primary provider while
Tailwind CSS contributes completions, hover information, and diagnostics.

```javascript
new EditorView({
  extensions: [
    typescriptClient.plugin(uri, "typescriptreact", {priority: 100}),
    tailwindClient.plugin(uri, "typescriptreact", {
      priority: 50,
      features: {formatting: false, rename: false}
    })
  ]
})
```

Bindings are ordered by descending `priority`. Completion and hover results
are combined across eligible providers. Features that need one owner, such as
formatting, rename, navigation, and signature help, use the first capable
eligible binding. A feature is enabled unless its binding sets that feature to
`false`.

Document edits are recorded once per editor. Each client keeps an independent
sync revision, and its pending `ChangeSet` is composed lazily only when that
client synchronizes. Thus, attaching idle supplemental clients does not add a
per-client loop to the typing path.

This example uses a crude transport that doesn't handle errors at all.


```javascript
import {Transport, LSPClient, languageServerExtensions} from "@codemirror/lsp-client"
import {basicSetup, EditorView} from "codemirror"
import {typescriptLanguage} from "@codemirror/lang-javascript"

function simpleWebSocketTransport(uri: string): Promise<Transport> {
  let handlers: ((value: string) => void)[] = []
  let sock = new WebSocket(uri)
  sock.onmessage = e => { for (let h of handlers) h(e.data.toString()) }
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    sock.onopen = () => resolve({
      send(message: string) { sock.send(message) },
      subscribe(handler: (value: string) => void) { handlers.push(handler) },
      unsubscribe(handler: (value: string) => void) { handlers = handlers.filter(h => h != handler) }
    })
  })
}

let transport = await simpleWebSocketTransport("ws://host:port")
let client = new LSPClient({extensions: languageServerExtensions()}).connect(transport)

new EditorView({
  extensions: [
    basicSetup,
    typescriptLanguage,
    client.plugin("file:///some/file.ts"),
  ],
  parent: document.body
})
```
