# c3-infra: owner rules

Hard rules first, index last. Each rule has a one-line why in `rules/*.md` (read the file for your topic on demand). Guards are named where one exists: `hooks/` scripts block at tool-call time, `scripts/guard.sh` checks this plugin in CI.

## Hard rules (every session, every agent)
1. Main only. No branches, no PRs; commit and push straight to main. Why: owner order, branches rot. Guard: hooks no-branch-create, main-only-push.
2. Never print or hardcode a secret; secrets files stay encrypted; no credentials as CLI args. Why: logs and transcripts leak. Guard: hook no-secrets-commit.
3. Never quote the owner verbatim in commits, comments, specs or tickets; neutral third-person prose. Why: publication rule. Guard: none.
4. Number every question put to the owner. Ask only when truly blocked. Why: answer by number. Guard: none.
5. Do only what was asked; explain/how/what-is questions are read-only. Why: scope creep costs trust. Guard: none.
6. Reports are short: result, files touched, verification, blockers. Why: token budget. Guard: none.
7. "New task" is a ticket: write it to the Product Backlog (repo cloudy-a-docs) first, build, test, push (rules/backlog.md). Why: single task ledger. Guard: test-backlog-metadata.sh.
8. Builds run in CI only. No local Gradle, no npm/npx, never start servers; `build.sh build` after source edits. Why: runners are the only trusted builders. Guard: hook no-local-gradle.
9. Android work is not done on green CI: the on-phone check stays pending on every close. Why: CI cannot see the device. Guard: none.
10. One agent at a time, within about 14% of the daily token budget; Opus orchestrates, Sonnet workers. Why: the budget is shared across sessions. Guard: none.
11. Never `pkill -f`/`pgrep -f`; never glob-delete in /tmp or /dev/shm; one Gradle/Android build at a time. Why: it killed the shell (2026-10-15). Guard: hooks no-pkill-pgrep-f, no-glob-rm-tmp.
12. Declarative: edit the source, never a generated copy (DO NOT EDIT headers); dist is committed code. Why: drift. Guard: per-repo byte-equal guards.
13. Agents start at ≤20k tokens. Pick the lean type; use `ops`/`infra` only when the task needs the fleet MCPs. Measure with a probe. Why: fleet MCP schemas cost about 45k tokens per agent. Guard: guard.sh lean-agent check.
13. Addressing: mesh first, public bearer fallback; c3-pvt/c3-pub; mesh names in the mesh namespace, never a public TLD; the vault is never put behind an edge gate the client cannot satisfy. Why: tickets #1100/#1104/#1117/#1123. Guard: fleet-addressing guard in cloudy-u-containers CI.
14. GitHub work uses the `gh` CLI or cloud-infra-mcp. The GitHub MCP server is denied (`deniedMcpServers`). Why: about 28k tokens per session for tools that duplicate gh. Guard: settings.json deniedMcpServers.
15. No cost-affecting changes (machine types, paid instances) without explicit approval. Why: free-tier fleet. Guard: none.

## Delivery
Source of truth: cloudy-u-linux `da_my-ai/data/claude/cloud-marketplace/c3-infra` (this plugin) and `agents/`. The former plugin repo `c3-infra-plugin` is archived (`z-archived_c3-infra-plugin`) and is not a source. Local sessions use the plugin via `cloud-marketplace` + `enabledPlugins`. Claude Code cloud sessions do NOT install plugins (docs: cloud-environments, "What carries over"), so the my-ai `dotfiles` engine (`da_my-ai/engines/dotfiles/deploy-dotfiles.sh`; cloud-infra `9_others/src/deploy-dotfiles.sh` is a wrapper) (defaults `_dotfiles/apps/src _dotfiles/apps/dist/dotfiles .`) refreshes the repo's `_dotfiles/apps/src/claude` from this SoT, renders `_dotfiles/apps/dist/dotfiles/claude`, and copies this skill to `<repo>/.claude/skills/c3-infra`, the hooks to `<repo>/.claude/hooks/c3`, the agents to `<repo>/.claude/agents`, and `settings.project.json` (hooks wired) to `<repo>/.claude/settings.json`. Edit upstream, never the repo copies.
