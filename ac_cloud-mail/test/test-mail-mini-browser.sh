#
# A link in an email used to leave the app. It now opens in a contained window with an editable
# address bar and a four-entry menu (Cloud Browser, Brave, translate, view as desktop/mobile).
# What this pins is the DECISION, not the pixels: one opener that every call site goes through, a
# scheme split that never pretends a WebView can dial a phone, and the two hand-offs that must
# stay external (OAuth, content:// attachments) still being external.
