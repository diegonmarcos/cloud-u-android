# cloud-mail named signatures (#206): static + executed proof that the signature field genuinely
# accepts HTML, that plain-text signatures are untouched by it, that the ONE existing signature
# migrates to the default of the new set, and that nothing an owner stores can execute when rendered.
# Same shape as test-mail-compose-signature-order.sh, because this runner cannot build Kotlin.
#
#   N1  the editor edits the SOURCE, so typed HTML survives recomposition (the label stopped lying)
#   N2  plain vs HTML is told apart by ONE discriminator, the one the legacy split already used
#   N3  the pre-#206 single signature migrates to the default of the new set; a fresh install gets
#       NO signature rather than one blank one  -- RUN, not grepped
#   N4  the compose picker reaches the identity's signatures and rewrites the body through the SAME
#       path the "From" picker uses, so the two cannot drift
#   N5  the render path sanitises the signature: on the wire AND in the editor's own preview
#   N6  every label this feature added exists in all nine languages
