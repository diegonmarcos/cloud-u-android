/**
 * WHICH boolean reaches `ImapSession.listFolders`, and at which call sites (#174).
 *
 * The decision itself is executed elsewhere — `withSubscriptions`/`parseLsubPaths` in
 * `:core:imap` (`SubscribedFoldersTest`) and `showOnlySubscribedFoldersOf` in
 * `ShowOnlySubscribedFoldersTest`. What no executable test on this bench can reach is the WIRING:
 * `MailRepository` opens an `AccountStore` (shared preferences) in its constructor and
 * `ImapMailService` needs a live session, and there is no Robolectric here — same reason as
 * [DecryptedSubjectCallSiteTest], whose source-reading harness this reuses.
 *
 * Both halves matter and neither implies the other:
 * - passing a hard-coded `false` from the repository compiles, keeps every other test green, and
 *   leaves the setting INERT on IMAP — nothing is ever hidden, the switch does nothing;
 * - passing `onlySubscribed` at a call site whose rows are DISCARDED costs an LSUB round trip for
 *   nothing. Three such sites exist and all three must stay bare: the rename-delimiter lookup, the
 *   connection test, and the push-wake refresh. `ImapMailService.listMailboxes` is a fourth — its
 *   one caller reads a role off the rows and writes none of them, so a flag there would buy an
 *   extra full listing on every archive and every delete, on exactly the big-folder-list account
 *   this feature was asked for.
 *
 * Assertions are on WHOLE trimmed lines, by equality, and they screen EVERY code line that calls
 * these functions — never `contains`, which is blind to any mutation that lengthens a line.
