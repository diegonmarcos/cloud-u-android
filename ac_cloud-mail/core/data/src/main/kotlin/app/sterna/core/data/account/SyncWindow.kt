/**
 * Per-account "messages to sync" window — how much of a mailbox to keep cached,
 * either by recency ([maxAgeDays]) or by message [limit] (ARCHITECTURE.md →
 * "Storage & retention"). Age windows still cap the fetch with [limit].
 *
 * On an age window the two numbers are read TOGETHER, and [limit] is a FLOOR on what is kept,
 * not only a ceiling on what is fetched: retention keeps the newest [limit] messages of a folder
 * whatever their age, plus everything inside [maxAgeDays]. A folder of ten old messages therefore
 * keeps its ten, while a busy folder still keeps only its ninety days (Codeberg #110 — before
 * this, the age was the only number retention looked at, so the setting could empty a quiet
 * folder down to whatever happened to be recent).
 *
 * [limit] counts MESSAGES, not threads: folder syncs are uncollapsed (the cache is
 * WYSIWYG and holds every thread member), so a window now matches its "N messages"
 * settings label exactly.
 *
 * On IMAP the window is where the reader's mail ends. Measured on the bench, same device, same
 * gesture, counted in the database per account and per folder: the IMAP Archive stayed flat at
 * 1 000 messages while it was scrolled to the bottom, where the JMAP Archive grew from 1 000 to
 * 1 150 under the same gesture.
 *
 * WHY it does not hold on IMAP is NOT established. Nothing below is a cause, only what the code
 * says. The scroll-to-load-more mediator is attached without testing the protocol ([pagedFolder]),
 * and its IMAP branch does ask the server for older pages ([folderMediator], then
 * `ImapMailService.fetchOlderPage` and `upsertAll`) — so "the app never asks" is not the answer.
 * Two candidates were read off the code and never told apart: every IMAP refresh re-walks the
 * window and its reconcile deletes what falls outside it (no cursor, so this runs every time), and
 * `endOfPaginationReached` may be frozen true by an early `Success`. What the JMAP branch has and
 * the IMAP one has not is a thread-aware fill (`MAX_APPEND_FILL_PAGES`, `APPEND_THREAD_TARGET`):
 * the IMAP branch appends one page of fifty and stops there. The unified inbox is paged with no
 * mediator at all ([pagedMailbox]), so it stops at the window on both protocols.
