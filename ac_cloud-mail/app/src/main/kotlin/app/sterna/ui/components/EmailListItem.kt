 * selected, and selection is what arms the destructive actions. Then [current], the row the reading
 * pane is showing (#103). Anything else — read or unread alike — is [card], the palette's CARD
 * colour (#472): black in the dark scheme, white in light. Read state is carried by the TEXT
 * ([mailListTextInk]), never by the row, so a filled background stays reserved for real
 * selection, which must remain visually distinct from a plain card. The bold weight rides the
 * same ink decision ([mailListTextInk]): it never branches on read state a second time (#478).
 *
 * [flash] tints whichever base was retained rather than branching, so it cannot erase the selected
 * or current state while it plays.

 * when a message is opened. `bodySource()` therefore fell all the way through to [Email.preview]
 * for every row, so "Resume Mail" summarised the snippet already printed on the row and "Copy Code"
 * hunted a verification code in a snippet that is cut long before one appears. Both icons were
 * drawn, both were tappable, and both answered about the preview instead of the mail.
 *
 * So the message is READ FIRST, through the loader the list hands down — the reader's own
 * `MailRepository.openMessage`, cache before network, and never marking the mail read: using an
 * action on a message is not the same as having read it. A list with no loader, or a fetch that
 * fails, falls back to [row] and the tools say what they always say about a message with nothing
 * in it — which is honest, where summarising the preview was not.
