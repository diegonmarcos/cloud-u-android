/**
 * The one surface both tools report through, on both surfaces they run on.
 *
 * [onApply] is what separates the two directions the owner named, and it is deliberately
 * the ONLY difference:
 *
 *   null      the message is one that was RECEIVED. It is read-only: the result is shown
 *             here to read or copy, and nothing is written back. The stored body is not a
 *             target — an incoming message is a record of what somebody sent, and a tool
 *             that edits it in place has destroyed the only copy of that.
 *   non-null  the message is a DRAFT the user is writing. The result goes back into the
 *             compose field, because that is where the user wants it.
 *
 * A dialog rather than a sheet: it is modal on purpose. A rewrite lands in the field, and
 * a control that applies text to a field the user can still be typing in is a race.

/**
 * [surface]'s tools as ONE ROW of one-tap icons, drawn FROM the surface's own declaration.
 *
 * The only shape either screen draws them in, and the only one there is. Both used to hand-write
 * their own: the reader listed Enhance and Translate, the composer listed its own pair, and the two
 * disagreed about which tools existed. A shared helper fixed that by generating one full-width
 * DropdownMenuItem per tool — then #293 replaced the reader's stack with this row and left the
 * composer on the stack, so the surfaces disagreed again, this time about SHAPE instead of
 * membership. #308 put both on the row and deleted the stacked helper outright rather than leaving
 * it callerless, because a composable nothing calls is exactly what the next screen reaches for.
 *
 * This does NOT filter on [TextTool.inOverflow]. A row IS a toolbar, so a tool that draws its own
 * toolbar icon draws it here — which is why AI Resume appears in this row while [TextToolPanel]
 * still uses the same flag to decide that Resume's OUTCOME is drawn somewhere else.
 *
 * [enabled] is the caller's own gate — the composer closes its tools while a send is in flight —
 * and is deliberately separate from membership. Whether an action EXISTS on a surface and whether
 * it can be tapped right now are different questions, and answering them with one flag is how an
 * action ends up permanently greyed out instead of honestly absent.
 *
 * [skip] is the caller's per-MESSAGE veto, and it is a third thing separate from both membership
 * and [enabled] for the same reason those two are separate: whether a tool exists on this surface,
 * whether it can be tapped at this instant, and whether it has anything to act on in this
 * particular message are three different questions. The reader hides Resume on a message with
 * nothing to summarise, and an action that cannot apply here is honestly absent rather than
 * permanently greyed out.
 *
 * [trailing] is for icons that are not text tools and never will be — the reader's Show Images.
 * They belong in this Row because the owner asked for the one-tap actions on ONE line, and a
 * second Row beside this one would put them on two.
