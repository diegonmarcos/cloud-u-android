/**
 * SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST. It reads `InboxViewModel.kt` and `InboxScreen.kt` as text and
 * proves nothing about what the app does. [RefreshIndicatorGraceTest] is the real test of #178 —
 * read it first: it EXECUTES the grace, the floor and the visibility flow on a virtual clock. This
 * file only holds the wiring, which no JVM test can reach: `InboxViewModel` is an
 * `AndroidViewModel` and is not instantiable here, and the screen is Compose.
 *
 * Each rule below is a one-word mutation that compiles and leaves the rest of the suite green:
 *  - `refreshRequested()` setting its flag AFTER calling `refresh()` — `viewModelScope` is
 *    `Main.immediate`, so the launch body has already started and the pull gets the grace it exists
 *    to skip;
 *  - the seed of the state flow carrying `showRefreshIndicator = true`, which puts the tern back on
 *    screen for the whole of every cold start — #178's third case, shipped by its own fix;
 *  - the seed losing `refreshing = true`, which is NOT this fix's field: it empties the centre so
 *    "this folder is empty" cannot lie during the first fetch (#63);
 *  - `PullToRefreshBox`/`TernRefreshIndicator` reading `ui.refreshing` again — the defect itself,
 *    restored, with every test still green;
 *  - the `ui.refreshing -> Unit` arm switched to the new field, which would let the empty-folder
 *    scene draw itself during a fetch shorter than the grace (#63 undone).
 *
 * Every rule compares a WHOLE unit — a whole declaration body, a whole named argument. Never a
 * `contains` on a fragment: a fragment is blind to any mutation that LENGTHENS the line
 * (`ui.showRefreshIndicator` contains neither more nor less than `ui.refreshing || debug`, and
 * `refreshing = true` is a prefix of `refreshing = true && x`). The price is that a reformat
 * reddens this test; that direction of error is loud and one line to fix.
