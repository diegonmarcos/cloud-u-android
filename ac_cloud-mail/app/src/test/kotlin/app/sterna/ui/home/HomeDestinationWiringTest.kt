/**
 * SOURCE LINT, NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST — the same instrument as
 * [app.sterna.ui.inbox.CollapsedFoldersSurfaceWiringTest], for the same reason: nothing in this
 * module can run a Composable or a NavHost, so the wiring between the drawer's Home row and the
 * screen it opens exists nowhere a behavioural test can reach it. Every link of that chain can be
 * cut with one line while every other test in the repository stays green, and this file is what
 * stands over it.
