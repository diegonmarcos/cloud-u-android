/**
 * Run a command in this terminal for another app in the constellation, and
 * hand back what it printed.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The watchdog app has to read the machine this terminal lives on, and Android
 * gives almost nothing for reaching into another app's sandbox. RUN_COMMAND
 * fires and forgets. A session is interactive, so finding the end of the
 * output means watching for a prompt or a pause, which truncates the moment
 * the phone is busy. The workaround was ssh to loopback, which turned one
 * question into four things that had to be true at once — sshd installed,
 * running, on the port we guessed, holding our key — and at least one of them
 * was false often enough to make the dashboard unusable.
 *
 * A bound service is none of that: a function call that blocks until the
 * command is done and returns its output. It works because we own both ends,
 * which is the whole reason this terminal was forked.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SAFE TO EXPORT
 * The manifest guards it with a signature-level permission, so only an APK
 * signed with the constellation key can bind — not a user prompt that can be
 * tapped through, and not something another app can request. Anything else
 * gets a SecurityException from the system before this class is reached.
 *
 * WHY IT REUSES TermuxShellEnvironmentClient RATHER THAN ProcessBuilder'S ENV
 * $PREFIX, $HOME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and $PATH are what make a Termux binary
 * runnable at all, and they are already computed here for the terminal's own
 * sessions. Building a second environment would mean a command behaving one
 * way when typed and another way when called, which is the kind of difference
 * nobody finds quickly.
 *
 * WHY IT OWNS THE PROCESS RATHER THAN CALLING TermuxTask
 * TermuxTask runs synchronously but hands back no way to kill a command that
 * never ends. A binder call that never returns wedges the caller's thread, and
 * on a phone nobody is sitting there to press ^C — so the process is started
 * here and destroyed on timeout.
