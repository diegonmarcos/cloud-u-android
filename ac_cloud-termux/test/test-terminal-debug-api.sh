# #747 — /api/terminal/exec and /api/terminal/selftest are wired, and run what a session runs.
#
# The route exists to test this terminal from outside the UI, so it is only worth anything while
# it (a) is registered from the application start path, which runs whenever the process does —
# no activity, no session; (b) enters through $PREFIX/bin/login, the entry a typed session
# takes, not a shell picked by hand; (c) bootstraps headlessly through the same installer the
# activity uses; and (d) runs the declared selftest list, which both terminals carry and must
# keep equal. Each assertion below goes red when one of those is undone.
#
# Static, offline, no Android SDK: it reads source only.
