/**
 * What Configs ▸ Panel ▸ Control can ACTUALLY do, one entry per control id
 * declared in `build.json::ui.control_panel`.
 *
 * ── The rule this file exists to enforce ──────────────────────────────────
 * NEVER RENDER A SWITCH THAT LIES. A switch that flips under the thumb while
 * the device does not move is worse than no page at all: it is a control the
 * owner will trust once, act on, and be wrong about — and nothing on screen
 * will ever say so. So every control here is one of exactly three things, and
 * which one it is was decided from what this APK holds, not from what would
 * look tidiest in a row of switches:
 *
 *   1. REAL SWITCH, in-process. [Control.set] is non-null and [Control.blocked]
 *      never fires. The displayed state comes from [Control.read], which asks
 *      the platform — never a boolean we kept from the last write.
 *   2. REAL SWITCH, permission-gated. [Control.set] is non-null but
 *      [Control.blocked] returns the missing grant, and the row draws disabled
 *      with that sentence under it and a way to go grant it. The permissions
 *      in question are ones this app already declares and the privileged plane
 *      already hands it (WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS, WRITE_SETTINGS,
 *      ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY, SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW) — "gated" means not
 *      granted YET on this device, not out of reach.
 *   3. NOT A SWITCH. [Control.set] is null, so [ControlFragment] draws a row
 *      that opens the exact system screen for it and shows the live state
 *      read-only beside it. Wi-Fi, mobile data, Bluetooth and airplane mode
 *      are all here, and the reason is in each entry.
 *
 * ── Why a write is not believed ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every [set] returns a [Verdict] computed by RE-READING the same source
 * [read] uses, so `ok` means the device agrees, never that a call did not
 * throw. That is the shape [WirelessDebugging.set] already proved in this
 * repo, and the reason the Wireless-debugging entry below is three lines: it
 * was already right.
 *
 * ── Where the data is, where the capability is ────────────────────────────
 * build.json owns PRESENTATION — which controls exist, their group, order and
 * wording. This file owns CAPABILITY. The split is deliberate and is not the
 * usual data/code line: a command and the read-back that verifies it are ONE
 * fact, and putting the command in JSON while its verification stayed in
 * Kotlin is how the two would drift into a switch that reports success from a
 * command that stopped working three Android versions ago.
 *
 * Blocking: [read] and [set] both may block (binder calls, shell channels).
 * [ControlFragment] calls them off the main thread; nothing here posts to the
 * UI itself.
