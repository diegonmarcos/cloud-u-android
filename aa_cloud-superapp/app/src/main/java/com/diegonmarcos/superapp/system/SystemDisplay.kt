 * Dark mode is a genuine device-wide setting — `AppCompatDelegate
 * .setDefaultNightMode` would repaint THIS app and leave the rest of the
 * phone light, which is not what "dark mode" means on the settings screen
 * it is drawn on — so [setNight] goes through the same privileged shell
 * channel the Battery Hunger levers use, and reports honestly when there is
 * no channel rather than pretending it worked. Call off the main thread —
 * that write is a shell round-trip.
 *
 * Scale is NOT device-wide any more (#601): [wrap] applies it in-process, so
 * it needs no channel and never touches a system setting at all.

     * looks like from the very first frame, with nothing left to grant.
