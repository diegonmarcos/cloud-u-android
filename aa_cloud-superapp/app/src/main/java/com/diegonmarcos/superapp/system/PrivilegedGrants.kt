/**
 * The ONE place that answers "which (package, permission) pairs may this app
 * grant itself, and are they granted yet?".
 *
 * It exists because there were two answers and they disagreed. The worker
 * (PrivilegedPlaneWorker) resolved targets dynamically while the Permissions
 * screen still iterated each build.json entry's `apps` array — so the moment an
 * entry dropped its `apps` array to go dynamic, READ_LOGS produced zero UI rows
 * and VANISHED from the screen while still being granted in the background. A
 * permissions screen that silently omits a permission is worse than no screen.
 * Both callers now read from here, so they cannot drift again.
 *
 * ── Why the platform decides, not a list ──────────────────────────────────
 * Which permissions `pm grant` can touch is decided by ONE bit in the platform:
 * PROTECTION_FLAG_DEVELOPMENT. We read that bit off the running device via
 * PackageManager.getPermissionInfo instead of hardcoding permission names.
 * Consequences, both of them the point:
 *
 *  - It cannot go stale. A hardcoded list drifts from AOSP on every API level
 *    and needs a per-API-level table to stay honest; this needs none, because
 *    it is the very same bit that makes `pm grant` succeed or fail.
 *  - It cannot over-grant. A permission without the development flag is never
 *    even attempted — there is no name we could get wrong in the "too broad"
 *    direction.
 *
 * The fleet filter is the other half and is equally load-bearing: these are
 * signature|privileged|development permissions and must never leak to a
 * third-party app that merely happens to request one.
