/**
 * "Install this app" for a package the device does not have.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ONE OBJECT AND NOT AN `if` INSIDE A TILE. Install is not one
 * thing. A fleet app is a direct APK URL pulled by libs:updater through the
 * constellation path; a third-party app is a store intent. Those are different
 * mechanisms with different failure modes, and the caller that drew the tile
 * has no business knowing which is which. Callers ask for an install and get
 * back [Outcome]; the routing lives here, so the NEXT surface that wants a
 * not-installed tile inherits it instead of reimplementing the fork.
 *
 * WHY IT RETURNS A MESSAGE INSTEAD OF SHOWING ONE. A TAP THAT DOES NOTHING IS
 * WORSE THAN A TILE THAT WAS NOT THERE. This repository has already shipped
 * the opposite: the updater was caught handing `installApk` a URL that 404'd
 * and reporting nothing at all, and a PackageInstaller session that committed
 * 267 MB and produced no install, no error and no change on screen. So there
 * is no silent path out of [start] — every branch produces a string, and
 * [Outcome.started] tells the caller whether it is news or a refusal. A caller
 * that ignores the return value is visible as such at the call site.
 *
 * NOT COVERED HERE, ON PURPOSE: a download that BEGINS and then fails (the
 * 404 case) is the updater's own lifecycle. ApkInstallWorker turns any throw
 * into `UpdateProgress.State.Failed(...)` and PackageInstallerReceiver drives
 * the terminal state from the real installer callback — both asserted by
 * test-install-status-surfaced.sh. Re-reporting it here would be a second
 * opinion racing the first.
