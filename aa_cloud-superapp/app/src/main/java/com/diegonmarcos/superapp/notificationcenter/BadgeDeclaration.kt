/**
 * #515 — `build.json::ui.notification_center`, resolved ONCE for everybody.
 *
 * Three things used to disagree about what a badge is: the Push pane drew all
 * eight producers because it had no way to tell a shade badge from a channel
 * inventory entry, `App.onCreate` hardcoded the one service it happened to
 * know about, and nothing at all knew which producers had to come back after
 * an update. Three readers, three answers, and the gap between them is exactly
 * where Quickmarks, Media and Alerts went missing: all three are owned by
 * FloatingNavService, which had no restart path, while KdeStatusService had
 * one because someone wrote its start call into App.onCreate by hand.
 *
 * So this is the only place that reads the declaration. [badges] is what the
 * pane renders, [restartServices] is what [BadgeRestartReceiver] re-ensures,
 * and both are DERIVED from the same list — adding a badge is a build.json
 * edit and nothing else.
 *
 * Deliberately free of `Context` and `BuildConfig`: callers hand it the JSON
 * text. That is what lets the unit test drive it with a declaration of its own
 * and assert on the RESOLVED set rather than grepping a file for a word.
