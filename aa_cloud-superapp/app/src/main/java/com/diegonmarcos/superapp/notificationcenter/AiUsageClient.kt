/**
 * #1151 One read of c3-infra-api `GET /ai/usage`, mesh first and then the public address with the fleet bearer, like every
 * fleet endpoint. Two legs behind two seams so the order is unit-tested without a network:
 *
 *  1. [fleet]: the app's fleet transport (libs:fleet-endpoints) - a registered fleet host is tried on the mesh and falls back
 *     to its public URL with the fleet bearer on its own. It answers null when the host is not a registered fleet endpoint.
 *  2. [plain]: the public URL with `Authorization: Bearer <fleet bearer>` held by this device (Cloud Account's fleet.bearer,
 *     else the Dagu login). Used when the first leg is not this transport's, cannot be made, or is refused (401/403).
 *
 * The bearer is never logged and never part of a message.
