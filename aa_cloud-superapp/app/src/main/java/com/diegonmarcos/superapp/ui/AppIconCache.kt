/**
 * THE one place this process asks PackageManager for an app icon.
 *
 * WHY (2026-09-19 crash loop): on this Samsung, getApplicationIcon routes
 * through Knox — the ANR trace's main thread sat in
 * android.sec.enterprise.ApplicationPolicy.getApplicationIconFromDb, a binder
 * call that had degraded to SECONDS per icon. Every surface that fetched
 * icons per-render on the main thread (the music island refreshes on every
 * playback callback; the Home shade re-renders per ntfy poll; the apps grid's
 * curated fallbacks) multiplied that into 30-second startup wedges, an
 * "Input dispatching timed out" loop, and an unusable launcher.
 *
 * Contract: at most ONE PackageManager icon call per package per process.
 * [cached] is a map read; [load] pays the PM price on first sight and caches
 * (call it off-main where the call path allows); [into] never blocks — cache
 * hit paints now, a miss paints later from the cache thread, tag-guarded so
 * recycled views never show a stale package's icon. Cached drawables are
 * handed out via constantState.newDrawable(): one instance across many
 * ImageViews would share bounds/state.
