/**
 * A section's pages behind ONE tab strip — the launcher's tabbed sections
 * (Suite = Cloud|Phone, Comms/Infos = Apps|Admin). Replaces the hand-written
 * `TabbedSectionFragment` + `SuiteCloudPhoneTabsFragment` pair: the tab list
 * is `build.json::ui.sections[].pages[]`, so no section or page id is spelled
 * out here.
 *
 * Phone — one pane, the selected tab renders into it. Identical to the old
 * two-fragment behaviour.
 *
 * Tablet ([MainActivity.isTwoPane]) — ONE PANE PER PAGE, all rendered at
 * once and side by side: Suite shows Cloud *and* Phone simultaneously. The
 * strip stays put so the chrome reads the same as the phone, and because
 * [TabLayout.MODE_FIXED] + [TabLayout.GRAVITY_FILL] give every tab 1/N of
 * the width against N equal-weight panes, tab *i* sits directly above the
 * pane it names — the strip doubles as each pane's header. Selection then
 * only marks the ACTIVE pane (the one [Collapsible] and the Apps/Admin mode
 * sync follow), since nothing needs swapping.
 *
 * Sections with more pages than [MAX_PANES] never reach here — the nav
 * controller routes them to the icon-rail + detail-pane layout instead.

     * strip reading MSGS / MY-RSS / CLOUD-RSS came out ragged, and Cloud's nine
     * pages made it worse. Ragged tabs also MOVE as you change section, which is
     * the part that actually reads as broken.
     *
     * So the slot is measured, not negotiated. The pills are MONOSPACE, so one
     * character width describes any string: the target is the LONGEST label
     * actually present in the strip, and the fallback floor is [MIN_CHARS]
     * characters. Sizing to a fixed seven was the first attempt and it was
     * wrong — the real labels run far longer (QUANT & MARKETS is fifteen,
     * AERO & SPACE twelve), so a seven-character slot ellipsized them, and the
     * ellipsis ate one of the seven, leaving six readable letters.
     *
     * When N slots exceed the strip the FONT gives way, a step at a time down to
     * [MIN_SP], because a smaller word is still readable while a clipped one is
     * not. Only if even the floor overflows does the strip become scrollable —
     * the honest last resort: nothing is hidden, it just no longer fits at once.
     *
     * The slot is the pill's own padding and margin PLUS the padding of the
     * TabView that TabLayout wraps every customView in. Forgetting that last
     * term is what let the row run past the frame and get clipped: the pill was
     * sized to fill its share exactly, then ~24dp of invisible chrome was added
     * around it. It is zeroed and then measured, and in MODE_FIXED the final
     * width is clamped to the slot — only MODE_SCROLLABLE may exceed one,
     * because there the strip scrolls instead of cutting.
