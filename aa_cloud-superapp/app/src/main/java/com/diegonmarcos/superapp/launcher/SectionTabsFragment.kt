/**
 * A section's pages behind ONE tab strip — the launcher's tabbed sections
 * (Suite = Cloud|Phone, Comms/Infos = Apps|Admin). Replaces the hand-written
 * `TabbedSectionFragment` + `SuiteCloudPhoneTabsFragment` pair: the tab list
 * is `build.json::ui.sections[].pages[]`, so no section or page id is spelled
 * out here.
 *
 * Phone — one pane, the selected tab renders into it. Identical to the old
 * two-fragment behaviour.
 *
 * Tablet ([MainActivity.isTwoPane]) — ONE PANE PER PAGE, all rendered at
 * once and side by side: Suite shows Cloud *and* Phone simultaneously. The
 * strip stays put so the chrome reads the same as the phone, and because
 * the shared pill strip (libs:bottomnav's [PageTabsView]) gives every tab
 * 1/N of the width against N equal-weight panes, tab *i* sits directly above the
 * pane it names — the strip doubles as each pane's header. Selection then
 * only marks the ACTIVE pane (the one [Collapsible] and the Apps/Admin mode
 * sync follow), since nothing needs swapping.
 *
 * Sections with more pages than [MAX_PANES] never reach here — the nav
 * controller routes them to the icon-rail + detail-pane layout instead.
 *
 * A PAGE can wear the same strip ([forPage]): Configs ▸ Launcher is one page
 * over the Theme and One-Hand tabs. This app gets ONE tab mechanism that way
 * instead of a second widget that has to be restyled and re-fixed in parallel
 * — the strip already knows how to list pages of a section, and a page's tabs
 * ARE pages of its section. Only three things differ, all off [ownerPageId]:
 * the strip lists the OWNER'S tabs instead of the section's pages, it records
 * its selection under its own key so it cannot overwrite the section's, and it
 * stays single-pane on a tablet because it is already living inside the
 * activity's 60% detail column rather than splitting the window itself.
 *
 * Compose since #773: the strip is libs:bottomnav's composable [PageTabs] (the same geometry [PageTabsView] drew)
 * and each pane is a FragmentContainerView hosted in an AndroidView, because the pages a section opens are still
 * Fragments built by [LauncherNavController.pageFragment].
