/**
 * The one place a reading about whether something is WORKING becomes something
 * on screen.
 *
 * ── Why this is an object and not four literals in a fragment ─────────────
 * A status light makes a promise — this thing is working, or it is not — and
 * the owner starts trusting it and stops checking. Two screens promising that
 * in two slightly different greens is not a style choice, it is one of them
 * being wrong about which green means healthy. So the states live here, once,
 * and the pages point at them.
 *
 * ── FOUR states, because reality has four ─────────────────────────────────
 * Red and green are two. The third is NOT YET KNOWN — the check has not run,
 * is running, threw, the platform declined to answer, or its answer has aged
 * out. The fourth is NOT KNOWABLE: there is no way to look at the thing this
 * row controls, only at a preference this app wrote down about it, and a
 * preference is what was ASKED FOR, never what is true. A firewall preference
 * says on while the VpnService behind it is dead and nothing in the store
 * knows; painting that green is precisely the false green this whole page was
 * written to prevent.
 *
 * Four states, THREE appearances. [UNKNOWN] and [UNVERIFIABLE] draw the same
 * — same glyph, same colour — because to the owner they are the same fact:
 * nobody can currently say. They differ only in the WORD, which explains
 * whether the answer is late or impossible. Two honest colours plus an honest
 * uncertainty beats three colours where one of them lies.
 *
 * ── Colour is never the only channel ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Red and green are the pair colour-blind users most often cannot separate,
 * and both are grey in a screenshot. Every state therefore carries a [glyph]
 * whose SHAPE differs — filled disc, hollow ring, question mark — and a word
 * from the string table, so the light reads correctly with no colour at all.
 * All three glyphs are already this app's vocabulary: ● / ○ are what
 * NetworkInfoPopup draws for connected / disconnected, ? is what
 * PermissionsFragment draws for a grant it cannot determine. [description]
 * is the same fact again for a screen reader, which gets neither.
 *
 * ── Why the colours are resources and not constants ───────────────────────
 * This app ships a black→purple gradient theme and two OLED themes that paint
 * the page pure black, and a status light is the last thing on screen that
 * may become hard to see. The values here are the ones that clear WCAG AA
 * (4.5:1) against BOTH of those surfaces — see colors.xml, and the tester
 * that recomputes the ratios rather than trusting this sentence. Keeping them
 * in colors.xml is also what lets a future theme override them without a
 * Kotlin edit; a colour compiled into a constant cannot be re-themed at all.
