/**
 * Central pause/resume switch for background work in the SuperApp.
 *
 * Triggered by the active launcher theme's `background_pause` feature
 * flag (build.json::ui.launcher_themes[*].features.background_pause).
 * Cloud Power Saving sets it true → on theme application MainActivity
 * calls [applyForTheme] and we tear down every battery-hungry
 * subsystem we own: Maps location tracker, ntfy / message foreground
 * services, WorkManager periodic jobs, Phone-tab cache warm-up
 * threads. When the user flips back to Cloud or Minimalist the same
 * call resumes them by no-op (each producer re-arms on its own next
 * onCreate / onResume cycle).
 *
 * EXCEPTION: WireGuard. Per Diego — Power Saving mirrors Samsung /
 * Apple / Pixel power-save (cuts compute, keeps connectivity), so
 * the WG tunnel stays up. The `wireguard_required` feature flag
 * actually pins WG ON in this mode rather than off.
 *
 * Resilient to missing modules: every call site is wrapped in a
 * runCatching block so the orchestrator never crashes the launcher
 * on a build that doesn't include a particular module (e.g. CI
 * builds without libs:maps).
