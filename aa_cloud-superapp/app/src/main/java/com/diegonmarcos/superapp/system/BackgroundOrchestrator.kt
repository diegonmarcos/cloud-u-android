/**
 * Central pause/resume switch for background work in the SuperApp.
 *
 * Triggered by the active launcher theme's `background_pause` feature
 * flag (build.json::ui.launcher_themes[*].features.background_pause).
 * A theme that sets it true → on theme application MainActivity calls
 * [applyForTheme] and we tear down every battery-hungry subsystem we
 * own: Maps location tracker, ntfy / message foreground services,
 * WorkManager periodic jobs, Phone-tab cache warm-up threads. When the
 * user flips to a theme that does not set it the same call resumes
 * them by no-op (each producer re-arms on its own next onCreate /
 * onResume cycle).
 *
 * Resilient to missing modules: every call site is wrapped in a
 * runCatching block so the orchestrator never crashes the launcher
 * on a build that doesn't include a particular module (e.g. CI
 * builds without libs:maps).
