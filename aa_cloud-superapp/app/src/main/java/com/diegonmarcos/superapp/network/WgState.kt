/**
 * Process-wide WireGuard state: a single [GoBackend] + a single
 * [Tunnel] instance, lazily initialised from application context.
 *
 * Why a singleton: [GoBackend] tracks the active tunnel by reference
 * (`currentTunnel == tunnel` check inside `setStateInternal`). If
 * [WireGuardFragment] brings the tunnel up with `Tunnel #A` and
 * [com.diegonmarcos.superapp.devcontrol.DevControlFragment] later
 * queries `getStatistics(Tunnel #B)` with a freshly instantiated
 * sibling, GoBackend won't recognise it and returns empty stats. The
 * shared instance avoids that footgun.
 *
 * Name is pulled fresh from [WireGuardPrefs] every call (so renaming
 * the tunnel via the form is reflected immediately) — only the
 * Tunnel *object identity* is fixed.
