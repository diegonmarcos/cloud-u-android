 * receives JSON and builds view models. libs:feed is in no module map of this app, so a feed
 * change republishes the engine APK alone.
 *
 * THE HANDSHAKE COMES FIRST AND COSTS NO BIND (the GhEngine shape): PackageManager resolves the
 * declared action in the declared package and reads its CONTRACT. Missing and too-old are two
 * different messages naming the Store, and a failed fetch is THROWN, so the pane says why
 * instead of drawing "No items".
 *
 * Off the main thread only: bind and network both block.
