/**
 * Runtime on/off for the floating button, persisted on-device.
 *
 * [FloatingNavConfig] already had an `enabled` flag, but it comes from
 * build.json and is therefore a BUILD-time decision — the user could not turn
 * the overlay off without a rebuild, and it restarted itself every time
 * MainActivity opened. This is the switch that was missing.
 *
 * The default is build.json::ui.floating_nav.default_on (OFF), NOT `enabled`:
 * `enabled` is the build's kill-switch and stays true so the switch can be
 * turned on at all. The pref only exists once someone has an opinion, so a
 * device that never touched the toggle follows the declared default, and one
 * that switched it on keeps it on.
 *
 * Deliberately app-side rather than in libs:launcher-onehand: the edge handles
 * and this overlay are two different services with two different permissions,
 * and giving the shared library a key it does not own would tie them together
 * for no reason beyond sharing a settings screen.
