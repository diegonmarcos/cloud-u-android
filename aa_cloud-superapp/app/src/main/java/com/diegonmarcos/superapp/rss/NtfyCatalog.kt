/**
 * Human names for ntfy topics, and the address of the advisory channel.
 *
 * ## Why a label table exists at all
 * A snake_case topic is an ADDRESS, not a name. `sec_yara` says nothing about
 * what arrives there, and a screen listing twenty-six of them is an inventory
 * nobody reads — which is the same as not publishing it. The fleet's own
 * registry (`cloud-infra/a_solutions/infra-obs_ntfy/src/build.json::topics`)
 * has carried a human `title` per topic all along; this mirrors it so the app
 * can show the sentence and keep the address as the subtitle.
 *
 * ## Missing labels degrade, they do not hide
 * [labelOf] returns the raw topic when nothing is declared. Same rule as
 * [NtfyScopes]'s last-scope fallback and for the same reason: an unlabelled
 * channel is merely less readable, an omitted one has stopped being watched
 * and nobody finds out. Adding a channel stays a data edit in
 * `build.json::ui.ntfy` (FIRE RULE #6), never a code change.

     * The origin every programmatic ntfy READ must use: the service itself on

     *
     * ## The public hostname has no anonymous poll route — not one that is shut
     * `rss.diegonmarcos.com` and this address are the SAME ntfy container
     * (`10.0.0.6:8090`) reached two ways, but they are not the same SURFACE.
     * Caddy's `mkNtfyBlock`
     * (`cloud-u-containers/infra-sec_caddy/src/caddyfile.nix`) opens exactly
     * one prefix to anonymous callers — `handle /feed* { reverse_proxy … }`,
     * unauthenticated because `feed_auth: "none"` — and that prefix is served
     * by the rss-gateway SIDECAR, not by ntfy. The sidecar
     * (`infra-obs_ntfy/src/code/rss-gateway.py`) publishes `/feed/health`,
     * `/feed/profiles.json`, `/feed/channels.json`, `/feed/<profile>.atom` and
     * `/feed/c/<topic>.atom`. There is no `/feed/<topic>/json` in it, and
     * every path outside `/feed*` falls through to
     * `handle { forward_auth authelia }`. So the poll API is reachable
     * anonymously by NO public path: the gated one bounces to SSO and the
     * ungated one does not implement it. MEASURED anonymously from a mesh
     * peer with the credential stripped (2026-09-09):
     *
     *     GET /feed/channels.json                 -> 200
     *     GET /feed/fleet_advisory/json?poll=1     -> 404  (sidecar: no route)
     *     GET /fleet_advisory/json?poll=1          -> 302  auth.diegonmarcos.com
     *     GET http://10.0.0.6:8090/…/json?poll=1   -> 200  (all 26 channels)
     *
     * ## Why the ungated path rather than a token
     * The gate is CORRECT and stays. ntfy's own access control already grants
     * what a read needs — `auth-default-access: read-write` in
     * `infra-obs_ntfy/src/templates/server.yml.tpl` — and the fleet already
     * treats wg0 as the auth boundary for reading this service, which is the
     * same judgement that made `/feed*` `feed_auth: "none"`. Minting a bearer
     * would add a credential that can expire, on a screen whose whole job is
     * to be trustworthy when other things are broken.
     *
     * `/feed/c/<topic>.atom` is a real anonymous per-channel route and needs
     * no mesh, but it is not a substitute: it answers 404 for
     * `cloud-sa-notifications`, `fleet_advisory` and `infra_mail-health` —
     * the three channels that matter most — because the sidecar's valid-channel
     * set is the union of its profiles config and the RSS taxonomy, and those
     * three are in neither. Twenty-three of twenty-six is not every channel.
     *
     * Human links go to [webBaseUrl] instead: a WebView carries the Authelia
     * session cookie and satisfies the gate, which is the tier built for
     * people.
     *
     * Declared in `build.json::ui.ntfy.base_url` so the origin can move without
     * a code change (FIRE RULE #6). [com.diegonmarcos.superapp.recovery
     * .AdvisoryFeed] deliberately keeps its own copy rather than calling here —
     * it is the escape hatch for a device too stale to update, and a lifeline
     * with one dependency is a lifeline with one fewer way to fail.
     *
     * Cleartext to `10.0.0.6` is permitted by `res/xml/network_security_config
     * .xml`, which enumerates the mesh peers.
