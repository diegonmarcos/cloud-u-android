/**
 * Makes the privileged plane self-healing across reboots with no Shizuku.
 *
 * The hard constraint: on a non-rooted phone only adbd can spawn a shell-uid
 * (2000) process, so "auto-start Shizuku" reduces to "run adb unattended" —
 * and that fails after every reboot for one reason only: Android turns
 * Wireless Debugging OFF on reboot. So:
 *
 *  1. If we hold WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS (granted once by this very plane, see
 *     step 3), flip `adb_wifi_enabled` back on.
 *  2. Autoconnect the embedded adb client (mDNS `_adb-tls-connect` + the
 *     keys stored at the one-time pairing) with backoff — adbd and its mDNS
 *     advert take a while after boot.
 *  3. Once up, `pm grant` every entry of build.json::ui.permissions.privileged
 *     to its apps. That list includes WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS for this app, so
 *     the FIRST successful connect (right after the user pairs once) is what
 *     bootstraps step 1 for every boot after. Pair once, ever.
 *
 * pm grant of a signature perm persists across reboots and in-place updates.
