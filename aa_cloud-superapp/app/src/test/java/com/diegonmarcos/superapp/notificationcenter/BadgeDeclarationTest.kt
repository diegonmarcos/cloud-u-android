/**
 * #515 — the badge system's two contracts, proven on the RESOLVED set.
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT read the shipped build.json and does NOT grep a
 * layout for "Quickmarks". The #497 pane shipped CI-green while three of
 * Diego's badges were dead, because every assertion anyone had written was
 * "does this file contain this word", and the files did. A word in a file
 * proves nothing about which services come back after an update.
 *
 * So each test here hands [BadgeDeclaration] a declaration of its own making
 * and asserts what the resolver PRODUCES from it — which is the same code
 * path `BadgeRestartReceiver` and `BadgePanes` run in the app.
 *
 * Robolectric because [BadgeDeclaration] parses with `org.json`, which is a
 * stub that throws on a bare JVM unit test.
