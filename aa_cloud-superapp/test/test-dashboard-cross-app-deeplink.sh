# Tester: Cloud ▸ Me's MyHealth icon is a cross-app deep link into
# Cloud-Me, and nothing of the two deleted SuperApp pages is left behind.
#
# MyFin and MyHealth were SuperApp pages (sections `myfin` and `health`). Both
# surfaces now live in Cloud-Me — Buro ▸ Fin and Projects ▸ Health. MyHealth's
# icon stayed put, retargeted to `extapp:cloud-me#<target>`; MyFin's icon was
# dropped from the row by the owner, so Buro ▸ Fin is reached from inside
# Cloud-Me and nothing here links to it. launchExternalApp
# launches Cloud-Me and hands everything after the `#` to it as the
# `shortcut_action` extra, which Cloud-Me's MainActivity.onTarget resolves with
# the same `page:<section>/<page>` grammar.
#
# Three ways that can rot, all of them silent on a phone:
#   • the fragment names a page Cloud-Me does not have → the icon opens Cloud-Me
#     at its front door and looks like it half-worked,
#   • cloud-me loses its external_apps install_apk_url → the icon does nothing
#     at all when Cloud-Me is not installed,
#   • sections[health].metrics is "cleaned up" along with the pages → Configs ▸
#     Permissions silently reports 0 / 0 Health Connect grants.
#
# Static and data-driven: build.json on both sides is the only source of truth.
