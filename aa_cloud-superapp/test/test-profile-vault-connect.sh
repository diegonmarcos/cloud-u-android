# Tester (#566/#569/#570; ported by the Cloud Account redesign task 8): Account > connect > Vault configs, and the
# cockpit's apps (the vault-backed fleet configurator).
#
# The page this first pinned (ProfileFragment, with FleetCockpitView and the Setup cockpit hero) was deleted by the
# redesign (a0_docs/eng-specs/cloud-account-redesign.md section 7). The vault fetch is ConnectWays.land now (every
# sign-in's one landing), the device pick is AccountDevice / the Account profile page, and the cockpit is Kit
# composables over the same VaultCockpit layout. So this reads those, not a file that is gone.
#
# The behaviour (wire format, section grouping, failure hints, device selection, mesh ownership by address, the
# per-section comparisons and applies) is executed by app/src/test/.../profile/VaultConnectTest.kt and
# VaultCockpitTest.kt. This file pins what a JVM test cannot see:
#   T1  every build.json::ui.vault_connect key reaches BuildConfig, and the Kotlin reads each BuildConfig field it
#       bakes (data, not literals); the route's endpoints are the fleet's ONE shared declaration
#   T2  every R.string.vault_* the Kotlin uses exists in EVERY locale file
#   T3  (#778) the cockpit's apps are Account > Runtime / Drift's apps: the runtime reader and pusher dispatch on
#       each declared `apply` (and every declared one has a reader), labels live only in build.json
#   T4  READING WRITES NOTHING: the fetch path and the runtime readers run no apply and touch no app's store; the
#       few things a sign-in or a fetch files are enumerated; every write is AccountRuntime.push, reached only
#       from the model's server -> runtime, reached only from a tap (or its debug op)
#   T5  the one-time code and the browser session are never stored; a pasted credential's box is emptied once sent
#   T6  the device is CHOSEN from the vault's peers (a typed id is only a new device's NAME): only its id is
#       persisted, and no address, key or hostname is a Kotlin literal on the mesh path
#   T7  the apps reuse the #565 inventory parser - no second parser, no installer
#   T8  the cockpit chrome is the Kit's: state lights and colours come from the palette, no private colour, no
#       animation (Power-Saving-safe); badge icons declared as data and present as drawables
