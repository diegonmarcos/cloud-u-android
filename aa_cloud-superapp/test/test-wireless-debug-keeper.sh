# Wireless Debugging keep-alive — the Android wiring around WirelessDebugKeepAlive.
#
# #290 found that nothing re-armed `adb_wifi_enabled` between launches. The fix
# was a 15-minute keeper that wrote the setting back unconditionally, which left
# two holes: it never reconnected the embedded adb client (the setting came
# back, the shell channel did not), and the owner could not turn Wireless
# Debugging off at all — the keeper put it back within the quarter hour.
#
# The decisions (switch gate, Wi-Fi wait, re-read after write, stale-socket
# drop, no prompt loop) are JVM-tested against a fake phone in
# app/src/test/.../system/WirelessDebugKeepAliveTest.kt. This tester pins what
# that test cannot reach — the wiring that makes those decisions run at all:
#
#   T1  doWork runs the tick with the OWNER'S switch, not a constant. Passing
#       `true` compiles, passes the JVM test, and makes the switch decorative.
#   T2  doWork asks shouldTick first; without it the prompt-loop guard is dead code.
#   T3  the periodic pass: unique, PERIODIC, 15 MINUTES (WorkManager's floor —
#       less is silently clamped), KEEP (REPLACE restarts the period on every
#       cold start and an often-opened app never reaches a run).
#   T4  switching off cancels the periodic work, the queued ticks and the notice.
#   T5  event ticks APPEND, never REPLACE: a replaced worker's thread keeps
#       running, and two overlapping ticks drop each other's fresh connection.
#   T6  both in-process triggers exist: Wi-Fi becoming available, and the
#       setting itself changing (a BSSID roam is not a new network).
#   T7  App start and BOOT_COMPLETED both go through sync().
#   T8  PrivilegedPlaneWorker's own boot-time write honours the switch — else
#       OFF is undone on every launch — and it is never on a period.
#   T9  the owner notice deep-links into Developer options, ongoing.
#   T10 switching Wireless debugging itself from the panel moves the keep-alive
#       with it, so the watchdog never fights the owner's hand.
#   T11 the switch is declared in build.json with its shipped default.
#   T12 doWork never returns Result.retry() — backoff on top of the period.
#
# FAIL CLOSED: a missing tool or a moved file proves nothing and says so.
