# Tester (#573, the A37): Configs ▸ Account ▸ Runtime ▸ "Apply all" for the mesh and mail cards.
#
# The owner's ask: import the vault bundle through Account, store ALL FOUR mesh profiles of THIS
# phone (its own peer, its own key — never the S21+'s), make config-v4-split the active tunnel
# and bring it up, and configure EVERY declared mail account for cloud-mail. The behaviour
# (the key rule, ownership by Address line, the active-name pick) is executed by the JVM tests;
# this file pins what a JVM test cannot see:
#   T1  the profile SET is stored by name, one tunnel active, the key in ONE slot — stored texts
#       carry <PROVIDED_BY_DEVICE>, and the stored set is never a second key copy
#   T2  config-v4-split is the declared default, as DATA (build.json), read by the Kotlin
#   T3  Apply all EXISTS and is a BUTTON: declared per card as data (runtime.apply_all on the mesh
#       and mail sections), drawn as a tagged ActionButton on the Runtime tab, dispatching to ONE
#       model function the debug API also calls — never run by a render path
#   T4  the mesh apply obeys THE KEY RULE: the device is the explicit pick (never inferred for a
#       write), the key is checked against the device's declared wg_public_key, a foreign key is
#       refused, and the no-key case names the Generate/import path instead of inventing a source
#   T5  the mail apply writes EVERY account with its password and the endpoints (JMAP/IMAP/SMTP)
#   T6  NO PRIVATE KEY EVER LEAVES THE DEVICE: the reports, the card status and the profile-sync
#       document carry no key; the only key source is the vault bundle or the phone's own slot
#   T7  the vault emitter declares the A37's own profiles under mesh.devices (its own dir), and the
#       cockpit files them under the same key shape
