# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO KEEP FIXED. build.json holds TWO unrelated
# phone-apps structures and they render as two different pages:
#
#   ui.sections[id=phone].phone_app_groups   QUICKMARKS -- curated, hand-written
#   ui.phone_sections + ui.phone_folders     ALL APPS   -- auto-classified
#
# On 2026-09-10 the owner asked for a Projects section "after Tools Primary and
# Before Configs". Configs is a quickmarks GROUP and appears nowhere in
# ui.phone_sections, so the anchor named quickmarks and could name nothing else.
# It shipped in ui.phone_sections instead -- the wrong page -- and every check
# that ran against it passed, because every check asked "does Projects exist"
# and none asked "where". Existence was never the question.
#
# So Q1 asserts POSITION, by index, with both neighbours named, and Q2 asserts
# the wrong surface is EMPTY. Either one alone is green on the shipped defect.

# Usage: ./test-phone-projects-quickmark.sh    (static only, no network, no device)
