# Tester: the constellation INSTALL path — every installer status reaches the
# user, and the one that needs an Intent launched actually launches it.
#
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO KEEP FIXED. Installing "Cloud Office"
# (Cloud-Sheets.apk, 267,216,449 bytes) downloaded the whole quarter-gigabyte,
# committed a PackageInstaller session, and then produced NOTHING: no install,
# no error, no change on screen. PackageInstaller reports the outcome of a
# commit asynchronously, so an outcome nobody surfaces is an outcome nobody has.
# Three shapes of that, all of them invisible at the 6-33 MB the rest of the
# fleet ships at:
#
#   1. STATUS_PENDING_USER_ACTION with no EXTRA_INTENT did `releaseGate();
#      return` — no toast, no notification, no state change. The progress row
#      kept reading "Installing…" for an install that was already over.
#   2. The confirm Intent was launched with startActivity ONLY when a
#      process-importance probe said "foreground". Android 10+ blocks a
#      background activity start and does NOT throw, so when that sample went
#      stale between the probe and the call the dialog silently never appeared
#      and there was no fallback behind it. Staging 267 MB takes long enough
#      that the user has usually left the screen by then, so the biggest app in
#      the fleet lost that race the most reliably.
#   3. Two statuses reached the user as a bare number ("status=7", "status=-999")
#      which names nothing and points nowhere.
#
# The assertion that carries the weight is T1: NO branch of the status handler
# may exist without a user-visible call in it. A new status handled silently
# fails this file, which is the only way a reviewer finds out before the owner
# does.
#
# Usage: ./test-install-status-surfaced.sh    (static only, no network, no device)
