# Tester: the constellation download path — resume, stall watchdog, and the
# four states a user must be able to tell apart.
#
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO KEEP FIXED. Installing "Cloud Office"
# (ghcr.io/diegonmarcos/cloud-office, ONE 278,215,660-byte layer — eight times
# the next largest app in the fleet) sat on "downloading" forever: no error, no
# progress. Three things combined to produce that, all of them invisible at the
# 25 MB every other app ships at:
#
#   1. No resume. Both download loops opened their target at byte zero, so
#      every interruption — screen lock, cell handover, the process going to
#      cached — threw away everything already fetched. A 265 MB transfer on a
#      phone WILL be interrupted; one that restarts each time never finishes.
#   2. A swallowing catch. ReleaseSource wrapped the whole download in
#      `runCatching { … }.getOrNull()`, so a timeout produced no log and no
#      state change; control fell through to GHCR, which republished
#      Downloading(0, …) and began the same 265 MB again.
#   3. No terminal state. Fleet.install threw and told UpdateProgress nothing,
#      so the progress row kept rendering its last Downloading frame forever.
#
# Static assertions + a LIVE check that the two CDNs actually honour the Range
# requests the resume logic depends on.
#
# Usage: ./test-download-resume.sh   (live section needs network)

# a pricing page, and a Go build wired the same way cost a day and a half of
# APKs on 2026-09-09. The GHCR branch below was always a SKIP; the asymmetry
# with this branch was the bug, not a decision.
#
# It cost another publish before being fixed: on 2026-09-10 this failed with
# "release CDN did not honour Range (got: nothing)" and blocked the SuperApp APK
# (run 34473051246). The CDN was fine. Cloud-Sheets.apk is simply no longer an
# asset on the `latest` release, so the URL 404s — a rotted hardcoded URL
# reporting itself as a CDN regression, in a step that could stop the phone
# getting an APK.
#
# THE HARDCODED URL IS GONE, and it did not need the API call the old note here
# feared. Both values are already DERIVED next door: regen.sh builds
# data/constellation-fleet.json from each app's build.json::release, so
# .release_url and .ghcr_page are this app's own declaration, one file away and
# with no network. That is what rotted on 2026-09-10 — the URL named
# Cloud-Sheets.apk long after the shelf stopped carrying it — and what would
