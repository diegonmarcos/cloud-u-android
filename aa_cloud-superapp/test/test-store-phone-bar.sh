# #565 — Store ▸ Phone Apps: one shared top bar, export/import, i18n'd, and one
# installer→store map. The rendered bar, the exported JSON and the import plan
# are asserted on resolved values by app/src/test/.../apps/StorePhoneAppsTest.kt;
# this tester holds the source-level contracts that a Robolectric run cannot see.
#
# T1 ONE BAR (#228). The bar's device controls live in exactly one file of the
#    store library and both Store fragments draw it. A second copy of any of
#    them is the drift the brief forbids.
# T2 i18n. Every R.string the store library names exists in its values/
#    (English is the fleet base, #298/#299), and the new screens draw no
#    hardcoded user text.
# T3 ONE MAP (#564 owns it: assets/appstore-install-sources.json). Export and
#    import CONSUME it through PhoneAppActions — the same installer read, the
#    same ours rule, the same store lookup the row buttons use — and no other
#    file in the store declares installers or deeplinks.
# T4 EXPORT/IMPORT go through the system document pickers, and the only installs
#    the import can start are the fleet's own path and (#571) the resolver's
#    declared direct ladder — never a foreign store's app through a store.
