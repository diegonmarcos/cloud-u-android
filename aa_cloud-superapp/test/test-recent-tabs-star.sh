# Tester: the Recent Tabs star (4th home star) and the midway row it shares
# with Centauri, plus the Configs order it sits next to.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: this change has four ways to be wrong that no compiler and
# no screenshot would catch.
#
#   1. THREE LISTS THAT LOOK ALIKE. This app already has "last 9 Android apps"
#      (Centauri) and "Active Apps" (the system Overview). Recent Tabs is the
#      owner's history INSIDE this app. If the external-app entries of the
#      shared LRU leak onto this star, the owner gets three near-identical
#      lists that disagree, and nothing fails.
#   2. TWO STARS ON ONE TAP TARGET. Centauri and Recent Tabs share a row. Each
#      star's touch box is its glyph plus tap_pad_dp on EVERY side, so if their
#      separation drops below that width the boxes overlap and the wrong menu
#      opens. The floor is arithmetic, so it can be asserted.
#   3. A HISTORY WIRED AT THE CALL SITES. Recording has to stay at the ONE
#      navigation chokepoint. A history that depends on every future screen
#      remembering to report itself is wrong within a month.
#   4. A SECOND DECLARATION OF THE CONFIGS ORDER. The Configs grid and the
#      Canopus arc are fed by ONE list. If a Kotlin-side order ever appears
#      beside it, "Panel before About" has to be fixed twice and will drift.
#
# Static tester (no device, no build): build.json is read as data, the Kotlin
# is checked for the contracts that data relies on.
