# cloud-keyboard translate bar: static proof that the reliability chain is
# intact WITHOUT a gradle build (this runner cannot build). Each check is a
# regression that made the bar "flaky" once:
#
#   T1  engine reply contract {source, text[, why]} on BOTH engines + the
#       orchestrator reads slot 2 (errors used to collapse to {"und",""})
#   T2  AIDL client recovers a dead binding and retries a failed bind on use
#   T3  every ML Kit await inside translateBlocking is bounded
#   T4  long-press one-shot: keyboard-language hint + stale-field guard + supersede
#   T5  bar: debounce, engine-side generation, LRU cache, not-connected shown on open
#   T6  settings: every TranslatePrefs key is rendered by the settings screen,
#       registered in the container, and every R.string it references exists
#   T7  AIDL: translateFrom stays LAST (transaction codes follow declaration
#       order — an older companion must still answer translate()), both copies equal
#   T8  ownership rule: no "HeliBoard" wording in the translate-owned files
#   T9  output re-sync engine: the bar owns ONE span of the app's field, owns it
#       as a composing region, gives it up when the host drops it, and never
#       writes after that — the three symptoms of "re-pastes the same text"
#   T10 the shared text box: no bar clips its own text, and no bar lets an
#       editing key fall through onto the field hidden behind it
#   T11 ONE editor, ONE interception point: both bars' boxes are the same
#       TextBoxEditor stepping whole graphemes, and every caret operation —
#       including the GESTURES, which used to move the host app's caret behind
#       the bar — resolves through LatinIME.activeTextBox()
