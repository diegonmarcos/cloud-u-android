# The toolbar row pages by a whole screen of icons: eleven on page one, ten on page two,
# Cloud Vault alone on page three. It has now shown four instead of eleven twice, both
# times because something OUTSIDE the paging arithmetic (ToolbarPaging) changed the width a
# key occupies. This runner cannot lay out a view, so the proof is the arithmetic plus the
# two things that feed it:
#
#   T1  every toolbar key gets its OWN page gap. One shared LinearLayout.LayoutParams
#       object was the four-icon bug (the View strip): the margin written for the one key that
#       starts its own page landed on all 22 keys, so a page sized for eleven icons fit four.
#       The Compose strip takes one gap PER KEY from ToolbarPaging.gaps and nothing shared.
#   T2  exactly one place computes the page-start gap of a toolbar key, and it is that alignment.
#   T3  the geometry: page = as many whole keys as the viewport shows, and with the shipped
#       key width on a 411dp portrait screen that is eleven, splitting the 22 default keys
#       11 / 10 / Vault. Fails if the key width or the default row grows past the design.
#   T4  Cloud Vault is last in the default row and is the key that starts its own page.
