# Tester: "turn Play Protect off" is a DECLARED Perms row with a MEASURED check
# (#632).
#
# WHY IT IS A ROW AT ALL. The fleet sideloads every app (#571 WE ARE THE STORE),
# and GmsCore's package verifier warns on, delays, or silently flags a sideloaded
# APK — a plausible contributor to #200 (Collabora installs silently with no
# error) and #163 (install stuck in downloading). It belongs in the setup
# checklist as a first-class item, not as advice in a paragraph.
#
# THE TWO WAYS A ROW LIKE THIS GOES WRONG, and both are what is asserted here:
#
#   1. APPENDED IN KOTLIN. Every other row on that page comes from a
#      declaration; a row hand-added in the fragment renders differently, is
#      invisible to the wizard, and is the #170/#102/#405 second-list defect.
#   2. A REMEMBERED FLAG instead of a read. Play Protect is DEVICE state — GMS
#      can re-arm it behind us and an uninstall does not reset it — so a stored
#      "done" is green on a phone that is scanning again (#622/#452).
#
# And one honesty requirement: Settings.Global.getInt needs a default, and the
# default is the stock-GMS value, so an ABSENT key reads exactly like a consented
# device. The row must be able to say it cannot verify instead of showing a tick
# it cannot justify.
#
# Nothing here touches a device: every assertion is over declared data or over
# source, which is all this container can honestly read.
