# Tester: the two camera entries the owner asked for on 2026-09-10 land on the
# two DIFFERENT pages he named, and the Cloud one keeps the position he named.
#
#   "cloud-sa/cloud/apps/tools primary: as last Camera (the Cloud-camera);
#    phone/apps/Tools Primary: add here the Samsung Camera App"
#
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR is that both pages contain a grouping called
# "Tools · Primary" and they are backed by unrelated structures:
#
#   Cloud ▸ Apps ▸ Tools Primary   ui.sections[id=cloud].tile_groups[title=
#                                  "Tools Primary"].tiles — the constellation's
#                                  OWN apps, each an extapp:<id> into
#                                  ui.external_apps.
#   Phone ▸ Apps ▸ Tools · Primary ui.phone_sections[prefix="="] — a SECTION,
#                                  whose members are the ui.phone_folders whose
#                                  label starts with "=", populated by
#                                  `pkg:` keywords over INSTALLED THIRD-PARTY
#                                  packages.
#
# Put the Samsung package on the first and the Cloud Camera on the second and
# every file still parses, every other tester still passes, and only the owner's
# eye on the device finds out. So each assertion below names the structure it
# reads, and the two package identifiers are checked against each other's
# absence as much as their own presence.
#
# ── THE HEADER ABOVE WAS ITSELF THE BUG, AND T9 ONWARDS IS THE CORRECTION ──
# "phone/apps/Tools Primary" is read above as ui.phone_sections[prefix="="],
# the ALL-APPS taxonomy. That is a THIRD structure whose grouping is also
# called Tools · Primary, and it is not what the owner asked to add to — he
# capitalised QUICKMARK the second time round. The page he means is
#
#   Phone ▸ Apps ▸ Quickmarks ▸ Tools Primary
#       ui.sections[id=phone].phone_app_groups[title="Tools Primary"].packages
#       — a HAND-WRITTEN shortlist, baked into
#       BuildConfig.UI_SUITE_PHONE_GROUPS_B64 and rendered by
#       SuitePhoneAppsFragment. No keyword, no classifier, no folder.
#
# So there are THREE same-named groupings, not two, and the taxonomy assertions
# T5/T6 pass with the camera absent from the curated list entirely — which is
# exactly what shipped. T5/T6 stay: they pin the All-apps classification so it
# cannot drift in silence. T9 onwards adds the surface nobody was testing, and
# T11 is the assertion the previous two attempts were missing — it re-runs T9's
# own predicate against a document with ONLY the Quickmark deleted and requires
# it to answer "absent" while the package is still written elsewhere in that
# same document. An assertion that cannot distinguish the three pages is
# decoration, and this is the check that refuses to let it be one.
#
# THE SECOND FAILURE is "as last". Nothing in this row carries an `order`:
# GroupedTilesFragment walks group.tiles in declared order and applies no sort,
# so LAST IS ARRAY POSITION and a presence-only assertion would pass while the
# instruction was broken. T1 reads the last element and nothing else.
