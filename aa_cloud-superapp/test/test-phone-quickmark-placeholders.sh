# Tester: Phone > Apps > Quickmarks -- a curated entry for an app the device
# does not have RENDERS as a placeholder, an enumerated section still HIDES
# what is not installed, and every curated package id is one the repository
# actually knows.
#
# THE TWO FAILURES THIS EXISTS TO KEEP FIXED.
#
#   1. A CURATED TILE THAT WAS NOT THERE. Until 2026-09-10 resolve() returned
#      null for an uninstalled package and mapNotNull dropped it, so an entry
#      the owner had deliberately written into build.json simply was not on
#      the page, with nothing to say why. build.json's own doc admitted it
#      ("Missing packages are silently hidden") and used it to justify keeping
#      our packages out of the list. That is inverted now, and T3 is what
#      keeps it inverted: it fails if the curated path grows a filter again.
#
#   2. AN UNRESOLVABLE PACKAGE ID BECOMES PERMANENT FURNITURE. While missing
#      packages were hidden, a typo in an id was invisible -- the tile just
#      never appeared. Now it renders forever, offering to install an
#      application that does not exist. T2 is the loud version of that: every
#      curated id must be declared somewhere in this repository's own
#      taxonomy, so adding a Quickmark forces you to classify the app too.
#
# WHY THE BLAST RADIUS ASSERTION (T4) MATTERS AS MUCH AS T3. The same hiding
# behaviour protects All Apps, Smart Folders, Active Apps and Last Apps, which
# are built by ENUMERATING the device. A placeholder in a list of what the
# device has would be incoherent, so lifting the filter there would be a bug
# rather than a feature. T3 and T4 are deliberately a pair: one says the
# curated path does not filter, the other says the enumerated path still does.
#
# Usage: ./test-phone-quickmark-placeholders.sh   (static only, no network, no device)
