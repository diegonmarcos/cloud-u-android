# "Text Resume" in the keyboard and "AI Resume" in cloud-mail are ONE feature over one
# prompt, and the settings screens show the prompts the code really sends. This is the
# static proof of both, WITHOUT a gradle build (this runner cannot build):
#
#   T1  the summary prompts have ONE home PER APPLICATION and the two are independent, and cloud-mail
#       holds no copy of them
#   T2  the prompt a settings screen DISPLAYS is the value the feature SENDS — same
#       function, one call, no re-assembly inside the preview row
#   T3  no prompt is a string literal in Kotlin, in either application
#   T4  each application sends its OWN summary prompt, and both land on ONE summariser
#   T5  a Resume never writes over the text it summarised
#   T6  the bullet shape is CHECKED after the reply, not assumed, and prose is reported
#   T7  the toolbar row is untouched — no new key, no change to paging
#   T8  the displayed prompts are read-only, which is what makes "how do I get the
#       shipped one back" answerable at all

# question. One home meant one owner, and the owner was the keyboard: from cloud-mail the summary
# prompt could be READ and not changed, because it was not cloud-mail's. The owner asked for their
# own set in mail. Two copies that are ALLOWED to disagree is the requirement, not the defect.
