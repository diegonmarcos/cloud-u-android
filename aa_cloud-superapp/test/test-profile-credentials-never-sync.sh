# Tester: the Configs → Profile credential fields, and the guarantee that
# neither credential can reach the profile sync payload.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. ProfileSync.document() POSTs the profile to
# /c3-infra-api/fleet/profile, where it is stored as a plain JSON file on
# oci-apps. The screen that builds that document now also edits an Authelia
# bearer token and the WireGuard interface private key. If either ever lands in
# the payload, a live session credential and the credential for mesh access are
# on the wire and at rest on a host — the precise failure that holding them
# on-device is meant to prevent, and one that would be completely silent.
#
# Today the document enumerates its keys, so the leak is impossible by
# construction. This tester exists for the refactor that has not happened yet:
# the day someone replaces the enumeration with a sweep of the preference map,
# T3 fails here rather than in production.
#
# Static wiring tester (no device / no gradle run): asserts the exact markers.
