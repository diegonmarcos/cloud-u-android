# Tester: Configs ▸ LAUNCHER IS A HEADING over four DIRECT pages (Presets |
# Controls | One-Hand | Notify), and neither the #154 merge that made it one
# page with four tabs, the #574 renames (Profiles → Presets, Modes → Controls),
# #580 moving Notify in, nor #649 promoting all four back out broke its stored
# settings or the targets that still name it.
#
# #649 INVERTED T1 AND T10 ON PURPOSE. There is no `launcher` page any more:
# Launcher is the `group` those four pages declare, so each of them is its own
# visible tile again and none of them is `hidden`. What this file is FOR did not
# change, because the two things a page move silently destroys did not change.
#   1. SETTINGS — a preference store keyed off a page id would have moved when
#      the page did, wiping every toggle the user had set. This asserts the
#      launcher/one-hand stores are named literally, so the id could change
#      (`launcher` → `controls`) and the page could stop existing entirely
#      without taking the data with it.
#   2. TARGETS — `page:config/onehand` is spoken by launcher shortcuts, edge
#      gestures, the radial menus and the App-Tabs history already on the
#      device. It resolved through the owner page + tab while One-Hand was a
#      tab; it now resolves directly, because the page stayed DECLARED through
#      both moves. A tab declared inline instead of as a real page would have
#      killed all of them at once, twice.
#
# Static tester (no device, no build): build.json is read as data, the Kotlin
# is checked for the routing contract that data relies on.
