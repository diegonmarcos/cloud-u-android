# Store ▸ Cloud row and Details buttons: DECLARED in libs:appstore's
# assets/appstore-fleet-actions.json, dispatched by id in the code.
#
# The ask, interpreted: Direct install leaves the row for the Details sheet,
# which also gains App settings (Android's own page for the package). In
# Direct install's old place the row gets Stop, immediately before Uninstall.
# Stop goes through the fleet's EXISTING privileged door — the ShellChannels
# ladder Phone Apps' Stop already used — not a second one, and with no channel
# armed it says so and offers App settings instead of doing nothing.
#
# Order and captions are the asset's; this guard reads them from there and
# checks the code draws exactly that and can act on every id.
#
# Override for mutation runs: LIBS.
