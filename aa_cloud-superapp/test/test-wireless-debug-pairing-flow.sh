# The phone showed "java.net.SocketException: Connection reset … Conscrypt
# SSLInputStream.readFromSocket" on port 35191. 35191 is a wireless-debugging
# CONNECT port (main screen); pairing ports live only in the "Pair device with
# pairing code" dialog and change every time it opens. Our Pair asked the user
# to TYPE an IP and a "pair port", so the connect port went into the SPAKE2
# pairing handshake and adbd's connect listener reset the socket. Shizuku never
# asks: AdbMdns discovers _adb-tls-pairing._tcp, AdbPairingService posts a
# notification whose RemoteInput takes the code, and the pairing runs in that
# foreground service. This tester pins that shape:
#
#   P1  both services are discovered over NsdManager: _adb-tls-pairing._tcp
#       and _adb-tls-connect._tcp are declared in AdbMdns and both are used by
#       AdbPairingService (pair on the first, connect on the second)
#   P2  the pairing port is never user-typed: no "pair port" field on the
#       Permissions page, /api/adb/pair reads no port, and the only caller of
#       EmbeddedAdbChannel.pair() outside the channel is AdbPairingService
#   P3  the notification carries a RemoteInput for the code, and the service
#       reads the code back from it
#   P4  the pairing runs in a FOREGROUND service: a Service that calls
#       startForeground, declared in the lib manifest with a foreground type and
#       the FOREGROUND_SERVICE permissions, and the pair() call sits inside it
#   P5  after pairing it connects and starts: AdbShellBootstrap.shellCommand is
#       exec'd and the app hooks onConnected to arm the privileged plane
#   P6  the bundled Conscrypt (exported keying material) stays declared in the
#       lib — Android's platform Conscrypt does not expose it
#   P7  the ADB Shell page's Pair only starts the service — no pair() in the UI, no Pair on the Permissions page
#
# FAIL CLOSED: a moved file proves nothing and says so.
