# Tester: the Canopus arc-menu (and every openSectionPage caller) navigates an
# action-page INTO its own section instead of rendering it over Home.
#
# BUG: tapping Constellation in the bottom Canopus arc menu (shown only on the
# home section) rendered ConstellationFragment straight over the home screen —
# currentSection stayed "home", Back went Home, the page never landed in the
# Configs section. Root cause: LauncherNavController.openSectionPage dispatched a
# page's `action:` (constellation → action:constellation) and RETURNED EARLY,
# before the block that establishes the parent section as the back-stack base.
# Non-action pages hit that block first, so they navigated correctly — the
# asymmetry WAS the bug.
#
# FIX: establish the section base (goSection) BEFORE the action early-return, so
# action-pages get the same parent-section context as normal pages.
#
# Static ordering tester (no device): asserts goSection precedes the action
# dispatch inside openSectionPage.
