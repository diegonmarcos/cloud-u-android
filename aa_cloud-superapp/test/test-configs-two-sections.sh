# Tester: #649/#723 — Configs is TWO declared sections, Launcher and Setup,
# and Setup has THREE subsections, Apps, Network and Observability (#878 relabelled; was Watchdog ▸ Setup/Mesh). #723 moved
# WireGuard and KDE (now labelled Peer Control) out of Setup into Mesh and deleted
# the AI page outright. Actions is untouched.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. A regroup this size has one failure mode that no other
# tester in this directory can see: an ORPHANED PAGE. Every page still exists,
# every page still parses, every page still has a fragment behind it — and one of
# them is reachable from nowhere, because it slipped out of the run of entries
# its heading covers and out of every `tabs` list at the same time. The grid
# draws the other twenty, the suite stays green, and the page is gone. T5 below
# is that check, and it is the reason this file exists; the rest is the structure
# the owner asked for, pinned so a later edit has to mean it.
#
# THE SECOND FAILURE MODE is a heading that looks declared and is not. Moving the
# words "Launcher" or "Setup" into Kotlin would render identically today and make
# every assertion here unfalsifiable tomorrow, because build.json would no longer
# be what the screen is built from. T4 greps for that directly.
#
# Static tester (no device, no build): build.json is read as data; the Kotlin is
# checked for the contract that data relies on, and for the literals it must not
# contain.
