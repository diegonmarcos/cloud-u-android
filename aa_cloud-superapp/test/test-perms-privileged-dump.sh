# android.permission.DUMP is what the ADB Shell page (dumpsys in-process, Shizuku stopped) and the
# fleet API's adb/grant-dump need. It was granted only by a tap on the Permissions page: the
# privileged plane's auto-grant pass (PrivilegedPlaneWorker step 3) grants ONLY the entries of
# build.json::ui.permissions.privileged, and DUMP was not one. Declared there, the pass grants it
# on every connect and the Permissions page lists it with the other privileged perms.
