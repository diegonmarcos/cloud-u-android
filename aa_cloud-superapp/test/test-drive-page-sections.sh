# Drive is no longer a section of this app. Task 302/304 lifted it out into its
# own APK (ac_cloud-drive, com.diegonmarcos.clouddrive), whose Files tab is a
# real local file manager rather than a list of remote back ends. Everything the
# SuperApp still owns about Drive is a LAUNCH: the Data Apps tile and the left
# handle's `down` sector both fire the package.
#
# The failures this exists to catch are the three ways an extraction goes wrong:
# a surface that was deleted here but still referenced (a tile or a route that
# resolves to nothing — a dead tap), data that was deleted here and not carried
# to the app that now owns it (silent loss of the twelve storage back ends), and
# the one-hand picker pair drifting apart, which is the documented root cause of
# tasks 111, 127 and 284.
#
# What this asserts:
#   T1  the Data Apps group still leads with Drive, and that tile now targets
#       `extapp:cloud-drive` — NOT the `drive` tile in Cloud ▸ AGI, which is
#       MyIDE files and a different thing entirely
#   T2  the extraction is COMPLETE on this side: no `drive` section, no
#       `drive_connections` panel kind, no DriveConnectionsFragment, no
#       DRIVE_CONNECTIONS_B64 — a leftover route with no fragment is a crash and
#       a leftover fragment with no route is dead weight that still compiles
#   T3  `extapp:cloud-drive` resolves — ui.external_apps carries the entry, with
#       the real package on both hub_package and install_package, and an APK url
#       that names its tag explicitly (`/download/<tag>/`, never
#       `/releases/latest/download/`, which any per-app release hijacks into a
#       flapping 404)
#   T4  every app in the Data Apps row carries a target the tile dispatcher has
#       a branch for, so no icon in that row can be inert
#   T5  PM Boards stays removed — #311 deleted the tile from Projects W, which
#       held its only definition
#   T6  the twelve back ends were MOVED, not dropped: gone from this build.json,
#       present in ac_cloud-drive/data/drive-connections.json, and actually
#       carried into that APK (gradle bakes it, the bridge exposes it, the page
#       reads it)
#   T7  the one-hand pair is byte-identical — the left handle's `down` sector and
#       the matching circular_menu.actions option. When they diverge the picker
#       finds no match, falls back to index 0 and shows a working slot as 'None',
#       one tap from persisting None over it
#   T8  the verb list T4 checks against is READ OUT OF the dispatcher, not
#       retyped here — a `when` that grows or loses a branch moves the assertion
#       with it instead of leaving T4 green against a shell that no longer
#       agrees with it
#   T9  a tap that reaches launchUri cannot throw out of the click handler. An
#       uncaught throw there is a crash on a tap — strictly worse than the icon
#       doing nothing — so every parse and every launch in that function has to
#       sit inside a runCatching, and the function has to end by SAYING the tap
#       failed rather than returning silently.
