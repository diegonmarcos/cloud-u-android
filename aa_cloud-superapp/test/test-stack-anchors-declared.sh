# Anchors are DECLARED, exactly like pages, so a broken one is caught here
# rather than by a finger on a tile that does nothing.
#
# A tile whose target reads `anchor:<id>` scrolls the stack it is already on
# to a view registered under `<id>`. Registration used to happen in Kotlin as
# panels rendered, with ids slugged out of display labels — so build.json did
# not know what anchors a page had, and renaming a label silently renamed an
# anchor. Now every anchor id is written down: a panel's own `anchor`, plus
# the `anchors: [{id, group, subgroup?}]` it declares for the headers it draws
# inside itself.
#
# What this asserts:
#   T1  every `anchor:` target resolves to an id declared on the SAME stack
#   T2  declared ids are unique within a stack
#   T3  every declared {group, subgroup} binding exists in cloud_services.json
#   T4  no anchor id is derived from a label anywhere in Kotlin
#   T5  the panels the C3 Index leads to are still declared (no regression)
#   T6  every CROSS-page `page:<section>/<page>#<anchor>` resolves too
#   T7  every `page:` target anywhere in build.json resolves to a real page
#   T8  every HIDDEN page has a referrer (a hidden page IS its referrers)
#   T9  no (kind, title) card appears twice in the same stack — catches a
#       copy-pasted panel (e.g. a duplicated "More" row) even though it
#       carries no `anchor` for T2 to dedupe against
#   W   declared-but-unreferenced ids are reported, not failed
#
# T8 is the one that catches the failure that prompted it. Making the C3 Index
# pure anchors left c3/{stack,vms,workflows,gha,logs,reports} declared, routable
# and reachable by nothing — a hidden page has no tab, so a tile pointing at it
# is the ONLY way in, and losing that tile deletes the page without deleting it.
#
# T6 covers the second form. A link that has to travel first is an ordinary
# `page:` target carrying a fragment — the web's own grammar — so it is checked
# the same way a dangling `page:` target is: the page must exist, and the
# anchor must be declared on THAT page's stack.
