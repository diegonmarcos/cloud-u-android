# #563 — both Store tabs group by the CENTRAL classification, Cloud ▸ Apps gets
# the All Apps section Phone ▸ Apps has, and the store's carry-over features
# (#496 #334 #140 #88 #274/#99) survived the move.
#
# NO SECOND MAPPING TABLE. #170, #102 and #405 each deleted a second copy of a
# package→group mapping. So T1 derives every section title and folder label
# from build.json (ui.phone_sections / ui.phone_folders) and fails if ANY of
# them is written into the store library or into the host adapter — the only
# way a shelf name may reach the store is by being read from the taxonomy.
#
# The Kotlin classification itself (what StoreShelves.of RETURNS for cloud-drive
# and WhatsApp) is asserted on the resolved value by the Robolectric test
# app/src/test/.../apps/StoreShelvesTest.kt; T3 here only pins the DATA the
# brief's two examples rest on, so a build.json edit that moves them is caught
# before a build.
