"""Every AI registry has a home of its own, that home is DECLARED, and no application reads
another application's block.

Called by test-keyboard-text-resume.sh's T1. It lives in its own file rather than inside that
tester because it takes the WHOLE declared set as its subject: the question "does anybody read
somebody else's prompts" is a cross-product over participants, and the shell that asked it used to
answer for one hand-written pair.

ZERO POLICY HERE. Every participant, its registry key and its source directories come from
test/ai-registries.json. A fourth application is one entry in that file and no edit to this one -
which is the whole point, because the version of this check that named its two participants in the
script went red the day a third arrived, inside a release that third application must not be able
to fail.

EXIT 0 = every claim held. EXIT 1 = at least one did not, and each one printed why.
