# A trailing lambda binds to the LAST parameter. Nothing else.

# WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR — run 34446987272, three errors on one line:
#
#   TextEnhancer.kt:184   fun rewrite(context, style, text,
#                                     progress: (Int, Int) -> Unit = { _, _ -> },
#                                     route: AiRouter.Route = AiRouter.route(context))
#   EnhanceBarView.kt:380 TextEnhancer.rewrite(context, style, t.text) { done, total -> ... }
#
# That call was correct the day it was written. A later commit appended `route`
# AFTER `progress` — a change whose own message said "the keyboard's callers are
# unchanged", and which touched neither the call site nor any file near it.
# Kotlin silently re-aimed the trailing lambda at `route`, and the call broke
# without being edited. Review reads the diff, and the diff did not contain the
# broken line, so the first thing that noticed was a ship run: no Cloud Keyboard
# APK for the fleet until someone read the compiler output.
#
# THE GENERAL SHAPE is a call site invalidated by an edit somewhere else, which
# normally only a compiler can see. This sees the one variant that is decidable
# WITHOUT one: a function whose LAST parameter is not a function type while an
# EARLIER one is, called with trailing-lambda syntax. There the lambda provably
# lands on the wrong parameter — there is no reading in which that call compiles.
#
# THE FIX IS ALWAYS AT THE CALL SITE and is always to pass the lambda BY NAME
# (`progress = { ... }`), which is immune to the next parameter being appended.
# Reordering the declaration back would only re-arm the trap for the next caller.
#
# SCOPE: every app in the repo, each resolved against the modules IT compiles,
# read from that app's build.json::modules — `dir` when a module is shared by
# reference, the gradle path otherwise, exactly as each settings.gradle does it.
# Not a list in here, and deliberately not one flat repo-wide scan either:
# resolving names across app boundaries matches ac_cloud-matrix's IconButton
# against the keyboard's Compose one and reports twenty-odd calls that compile
# perfectly well. A checker that cries wolf gets muted, and a muted checker is
# worth exactly as much as no checker.
#
# It lives under aa_cloud-superapp/test/ because that is a directory CI actually
# executes; ac_cloud-keyboard — the app that went red — has no test/ directory
# and no build.json::tests block, so a tester placed there would run nowhere.
#
# CEILING, stated rather than hidden: only calls whose `(` and `) {` sit on the
# SAME line are matched, and names resolve by name alone within an app. This
# does not replace compiling. It replaces waiting for CI to compile.
#
# Run from anywhere:  bash aa_cloud-superapp/test/test-kotlin-lambda-arg-position.sh
