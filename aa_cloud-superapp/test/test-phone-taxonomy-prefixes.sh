#
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO KEEP FIXED. ui.phone_sections buckets a folder
# under a section by its label's FIRST CHARACTER: "-" Services · Buro, "+"
# Services · Others, "_" Tools · System, "@" Tools · Inboxes & AI, "." Tools ·
# Data Apps, "=" Tools · Primary, ">" Tools · Media, "*" Tools · Health. A
# folder whose label starts with none of those belongs to NO section and
# renders last, in the prefix-less sink area at the bottom of the page.
#
# So a folder label is not a label. It is the label AND the section membership
# in one string, and the two are indistinguishable to anyone renaming it. The
# owner asked to rename "_Dev & Terminal" to "Dev" on 2026-09-10; doing that
# literally would have dropped the "_" and evicted the folder from Tools ·
# System into the unsectioned sink -- a rename in the diff, a deletion on the
# device, and nothing anywhere would have said so. It shipped as "_Dev".
#
# T1 is the assertion that carries the weight, and it deliberately covers
# EVERY folder rather than the ones that task touched: the trap is not in any
# one folder, it is in the schema, so the guard has to be too.
#
# WHY EVERY jq CALL GOES THROUGH q(). The first draft of this file asked
# `$prefixes | index(.label[0:1])`, which is a jq scoping error -- inside
# `A | index(B)`, B is evaluated with `.` bound to A, so `.label` was read off
# the prefix ARRAY and jq exited 5 with "Cannot index array with string". The
# assertion then tested `[ -z "$OUTPUT" ]`, output was empty because jq had
# DIED, and the tester printed PASS. That is a verdict drawn from a tool's
# failure -- the same shape as the four testers here that were green only
# because ripgrep was missing. q() reads jq's own exit status, outside any
# pipe, and makes a broken filter fatal instead of green.
