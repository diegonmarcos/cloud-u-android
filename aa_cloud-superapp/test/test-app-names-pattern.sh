# Tester (#351): every application in the constellation has ONE name, it is
# written cloud-<name> (or c3-<name> for the c3 family), and no surface spells it
# any other way.
#
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR. Configs ▸ Constellation listed
#   "Cloud Chat (Mattermost)", "Cloud Dialer (Fossify)", "Cloud Mail",
#   "Cloud Office", "Cloud Terminal (Nix)", "Cloud Terminal (Termux)", "Messenger"
# beside cloud-agenda, cloud-browser and the rest. The owner had asked for the
# pattern twice before. The root cause was not the list: fork-apps declared their
# name in .forks.<key>.label while top-level apps used .name, and the superapp
# restated every name again in ui.external_apps, onehand.apps,
# ui.ai_routing_peers, tiles and floating_nav — so a rename fixed one copy and
# the other copies kept the old spelling.
#
# The declaration is each application's own build.json::.name. regen.sh reads
# it into constellation-fleet.json for BOTH branches, and the fleet file is what
# this tester trusts as the list of names.
#
#   T1  every fleet entry of kind "app" is named cloud-<x> or c3-<x>, unique
#   T2  that name IS the app's build.json::.name, and no fork entry of the same
#       package declares a second name in .forks.<key>.label
#   T3  ui.external_apps restates no name: label absent (the id is shown) and the
#       id is a fleet name
#   T4  any object that names a fleet package (package/pkg) with a label uses the
#       fleet name for it
#   T5  sweep: no label/title/name anywhere in those build.json files spells a
#       fleet name the old way ("Cloud Chat (Mattermost)", "Cloud-IDE",
#       "C3-Watchdog") — the regression a new hand-written roster would bring back
#
# Scope: kind "app". Library APKs ("Lib: <module>") are a separate naming family
# and are not applications. Captions that name a FUNCTION rather than an app
# (tiles "Notes", "Mail", the "Messenger" inbox class) do not spell an app name
# and are left alone by T5 on purpose.
