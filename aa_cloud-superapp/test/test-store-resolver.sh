# #571 WE ARE THE STORE — the source resolver's declaration and its readers.
# Behaviour (parse refusals, actions, the rendered empty-phone page) is asserted
# by app/src/test/.../apps/StoreResolverTest.kt; this tester holds the contracts
# a Robolectric run cannot see, and PROVES ITSELF BY MUTATION: the validator in
# T1 is run again over deliberately broken copies of the declaration and must go
# RED on each — a validator that passes a fake Play URL is no validator.
#
# T1 DECLARATION HONESTY (validator + mutations). One `resolver` block inside
#    the ONE #564 map; `order` and `kinds` name the SAME kinds in the same
#    order (#627, so the page's source tabs are the declaration). Every app row
#    is EXACTLY ONE of: a ladder (non-empty, a strict subsequence of `order`),
#    or `unresolved` (a non-blank reason and no rung at all: the row says why
#    there is nothing to install from). Every row declares `integrity`. A
#    `play` / `play-anon` rung carries nothing but its kind (Play publishes no
#    APK URL; play-anon's URLs come from Play's delivery at fetch time). Since
#    play-anon fetches Play's own catalogue, a declared `play` hand-off always
#    sits BELOW a `play-anon` rung: no declared row is Play-only, and the
#    Play-only case is an UNDECLARED package, which SourceResolver.resolve
#    falls back to the Play hand-off alone. Every vendor `apk`/`feed`/`sha256`
#    is https; no URL anywhere points at play.google.com; the F-Droid signer
#    pin is a 64-hex sha256; at least one app this store fetches itself and one
#    it cannot (the hand-off / badge path) are declared.
# T2 ONE INSTALLER, ONE DOWNLOADER. ExternalInstall commits through
#    Fleet.commit and nothing else; SourceResolver and FDroidIndex download
#    through the updater's Download; no store file opens its own
#    HttpURLConnection for bytes, names a PackageInstaller, or names an
#    installer package (#564's rule, extended to the new files).
# T3 F-DROID IS VERIFIED. FDroidIndex opens the index as a verifying JarFile,
#    reads codeSigners, compares against the declared pin, and refuses an
#    unsigned entry; APKs are VerifiedApk.byDigest against the index hash.
# T4 THE PAGE. Phone Apps passes real Install all / Update all verbs, builds its
#    rows from installed ∪ fleet ∪ declared, and derives every not-installed
#    row's buttons from PhoneAppActions.forMissing.
# T5 REGISTRATION. The JVM test exists and names the honesty cases.
