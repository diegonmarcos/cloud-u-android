# Tester: Configs ▸ Launcher ▸ One-Hand — the Canopus star's ACTIONS list.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: "Copy Info" was removed from that list, and removing an
# entry from a data-driven menu has exactly two ways to go wrong quietly.
#
#   1. THE ENTRY COMES BACK, OR THE WRONG ONE GOES. The Canopus arc's inner
#      ring is not written anywhere in Kotlin — it is the `is_action` pages of
#      the `config` section plus `onehand.arc_menu.actions`. One list, two
#      surfaces (the star AND the Configs grid), which is the whole reason the
#      entry could only be deleted once. A future edit that re-adds it, drops a
#      neighbour, or reorders them is a UI change with no compiler opinion.
#   2. A STORED PREFERENCE STILL NAMES IT. Targets are persisted on-device
#      (recent-tiles LRU, power-saving home slots, one-hand gesture overrides).
#      A preference written before the removal outlives the APK that removed
#      it, so the dispatcher must treat an unknown action as a defined no-op.
#      An unhandled branch here is a blank slot or a crash on a device that has
#      been in use — never on a fresh install, so never in a smoke test.
#
# Static tester (no device, no build): build.json is read as data, the Kotlin is
# checked for the contracts that data relies on.
