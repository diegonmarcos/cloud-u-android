# Tester: the Writer tile on Cloud ▸ Tools Primary.
#
# The owner asked for one thing — "cloud-sa/cloud/tools primary: add here
# 'Writer' the cloud-writer icon link" — and the ways a change like that
# reports green while giving him a dead tile are all known, because this
# repository has shipped every one of them:
#
#   • "build.json contains the string Writer" proves a string is in a file.
#     It cannot tell the Cloud page from the Phone page, and those two have
#     an identically-named "Tools Primary" grouping (see build.json's
#     _doc_samsung_camera, where two earlier attempts landed in the wrong
#     one). So T1 resolves the page the way Sections.parse does — section by
#     `id`, group by `title` — and asserts the tile is IN THAT GROUP.
#
#   • A package-name typo compiles, ships, and gives him a tile that opens
#     nothing. T3 never writes the package down: it reads it out of
#     ac_cloud-writer's OWN two declarations and asserts all four copies
#     agree. A tester that restated the string would pass on the typo.
#
#   • A tile whose extapp: id has no ui.external_apps entry snacks
#     "Unknown app" AFTER the tap. T4 pins the entry the not-installed path
#     needs; T1 of test-app-identity-resolves.sh enforces the same rule
#     fleet-wide and this states it for the tile the owner asked for.
#
# Every check fails closed: an empty jq result, a missing file and an
# unreadable field are all FAIL, never "nothing to compare so pass".
