# Tester: a notification is read because the user SWIPED it, and swiping did
# not cost the page its vertical scroll.
#
# BEFORE: "unread" was derived — `ts > previous visit`. Nothing recorded that
# a specific row had been read, so the whole list flipped to read the moment
# you left the page, and Show=Unread answered "arrived recently" rather than
# "not dealt with".
#
# NOW: read state is an explicit per-entry set in StackFilters, keyed by each
# stream's own stable id and namespaced per stream so it can be pruned. The
# watermark stays, but only to answer a DIFFERENT question — the "N new" chip.
#
# These are the invariants that would regress silently, so they are pinned:
#   T1  the unread predicate reads the stored set, not the watermark
#   T2  the "N new" chip still counts arrival (the watermark keeps ONE job)
#   T3  Show=Unread and the swipe agree (one predicate, not two)
#   T4  the swipe only claims the gesture when it is HORIZONTAL
#   T5  read keys are namespaced and pruned against a COMPLETE enumeration
#   T6  an unavailable ntfy poll prunes nothing
#   T7  prefs are committed, and the page key is set even without a filter row
#   T8  still zero RecyclerView / ItemTouchHelper / child fragments on this path
#   T9  the gesture is visibly answered and reversible
#   T10 the page does not narrate itself — no section subtitle describing what
#       a section is, no empty state written as a paragraph
