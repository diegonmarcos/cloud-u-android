# ║ #663 — C3 IS AN APP: it is in the Store, and Cloud ▸ Apps ▸ Configs      ║
# ║ opens the APK. And the surface it came from is not orphaned yet.         ║
# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# WHY THIS LIVES HERE AND NOT IN ac_cloud-c3/test. Every assertion below reads
# THIS application's declarations — build.json and the fleet manifest. A tester
# under ac_cloud-c3/ that reached into aa_cloud-superapp/ would be reading foreign
# source, which cloud-android-test-engine.sh downgrades to a WARNING: it could
# never fail a release, so it would be a green that verified nothing (#639). The
# owner of a declaration owns the tester that holds it.
#
#   T1  cloud-c3 is IN THE STORE: the fleet manifest carries a COMPLETE row —
#       package, registry/namespace/image, tag, asset, release_url, repo_url,
#       ghcr_page, version_name, version_code, per-ABI assets — with kind `app`
#       and group `apps`. #276 is why every field is checked and not just
#       presence of the row: a half-filled fleet entry has NO symptom, it draws
#       an empty page that looks exactly like a working one.
#   T2  Cloud ▸ Apps ▸ Configs opens the APPLICATION: that tile's target is
#       extapp:cloud-c3 and NOT a page: route. "The C3 page now is a app" —
#       a tile still pointing at page:c3/... is the whole defect of this ticket.
#   T3  the tile can RESOLVE: ui.external_apps declares cloud-c3 with a package,
#       because Sections.externalApp() reads ONLY that array — without an entry
#       the tap snacks "Unknown app" instead of offering the APK.
#   T4  the declaration restates no name: that entry carries NO `label`, so the
#       application has one name (#351, the copy #224 reverted). The displayed
#       caption is DERIVED by dropping the family prefix.
#   T5  NO ORPHAN, IN EITHER DIRECTION. The in-app C3 section is still present
#       because its five live feeds, NTFY centre and three container dashboards
#       are NOT ported into the APK yet. While it is present it must stay
#       REACHABLE — a section nothing links to is invisible, working, and dead.
#       When it is finally deleted this check inverts: see the note at T5.
#   M   mutation-proof: a page: target back on the Configs tile, a removed
#       external_apps entry, a label added back, a gutted fleet row and a C3
#       section with every inbound link cut each go RED.
#
# OWN-SOURCE ONLY. python3 and jq.
