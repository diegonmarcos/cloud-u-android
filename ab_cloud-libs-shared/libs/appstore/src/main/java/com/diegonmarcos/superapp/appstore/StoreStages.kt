/**
 * #774 DOWNLOAD → INSTALL → CLEAR, as three stages a Store row can show and a
 * user (or the auto chain) can drive one at a time. No UI here: the Cloud tab,
 * the debug API and the auto chain all read [stage] and call the same three
 * verbs, so the screen and `/api/store/stage` cannot disagree.
 *
 * The stage is DERIVED, never stored: the persistent cache ([ApkCache], under
 * no_backup) plus what the device has installed plus the last outcome note
 * ([ApkCache.note], written by the download path and the install receiver).
 * That is what makes it survive an install cancel, a failure, an app restart
 * and a reboot — there is no in-memory state to lose except "a verb is running
 * right now", which is exactly the part that should vanish with the process.
 *
 *  - Download fetches into the cache ([Fleet.download]: cache-hit first, then
 *    Range-resumable sources, verified by the release sha256).
 *  - Install is the WHOLE chain (#784): no installable cached APK → Download
 *    first, then hand the CACHED file to the existing installer ladder
 *    ([FleetInstall.install] → shell `pm install`, else a PackageInstaller
 *    session), then Clear once [ApkCache.landed] proves the install. It is
 *    never disabled for want of a cache. A cancel or failure stops the chain at
 *    that stage and leaves the file; Install again resumes from there.
 *  - Clear deletes the app's cached APK(s) — on demand, or by the chain once
 *    the install is proven.
 *  - [downloadAll] / [updateAll] are the same verbs over a list, with a
 *    per-app report and a dry run; Update all installs from the cache with no
 *    network at all.
