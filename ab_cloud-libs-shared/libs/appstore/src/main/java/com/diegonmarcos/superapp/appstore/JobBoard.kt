 * One state entry per job, keyed (the package), so concurrent downloads and an install
 * never read each other's state. The Store used to draw ONE shared "current job", and
 * every row that ran at the same time fought over it. Pure Kotlin: a JVM test drives it.
 *
 * Rules: a row only moves by events carrying its own key; its byte count and percent never
 * go down; a finished row (done / failed) ignores late events until it is queued again;
 * a failure stays in its own row and costs the others nothing.
