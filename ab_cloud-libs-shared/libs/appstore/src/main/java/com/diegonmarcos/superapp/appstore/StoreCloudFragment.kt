/**
 * Store ▸ Cloud Constellation (#563) — the page that used to BE the store
 * ("Constellation AppStore"), now the first of Store's two subpages. superapp
 * is the fleet manager: install / update / uninstall / open every
 * constellation APK. Its sibling [StorePhoneFragment] covers every APK that is
 * NOT in the fleet.
 *
 * IDENTITY vs TITLE. "Constellation" survives here as a display word only —
 * the subpage's label, which build.json declares beside its id. Nothing that
 * ROUTES to this page (class, page id, target) says constellation; the
 * fleet's own names (constellation-fleet.json, CONSTELLATION_DATA,
 * [ConstellationWorker]) are the fleet's identity, not the store's, and
 * stay. test-store-identity.sh holds that line.
 *
 * Each app's status is fetched on its OWN thread (concurrently), so one slow or
 * unreachable image never blocks the others — the previous single-thread loop
 * was why Dialer showed no status and unpublished Chat looked "stuck". Fleet
 * list is data-driven from BuildConfig.CONSTELLATION_FLEET_B64.
 *
 * Compose: every row is a function of three maps this page holds — the network [states], the cache
 * [stages] and the [checking] marks — so a check thread landing only writes its answer and the row
 * redraws itself; nothing here reaches into a row.
