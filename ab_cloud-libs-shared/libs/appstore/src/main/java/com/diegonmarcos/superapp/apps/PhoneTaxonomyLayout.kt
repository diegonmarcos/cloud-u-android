 * THE ORDER of the Phone taxonomy on screen: sections in `ui.phone_sections` order, each holding
 * the folders (sub-categories) whose label starts with its prefix, in the folders' own order, and
 * then one trailing group of the folders no section prefix claims.
 *
 * SuperApp ▸ Phone (PhoneAppsFragment.renderAllApps) and Cloud Store ▸ Phone ▸ Search's landing
 * both lay their groups out through [bucket], so the two cannot list the same taxonomy in two
 * orders. The data is shared already ([PhoneSections], [PhoneFolders], baked from SuperApp's
 * build.json into this lib); this is the shared reading of it.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin on purpose (no Android types): ac_cloud-store/test/test-store-search-landing.sh
 * compiles it with kotlinc and checks the order on a plain JVM.
