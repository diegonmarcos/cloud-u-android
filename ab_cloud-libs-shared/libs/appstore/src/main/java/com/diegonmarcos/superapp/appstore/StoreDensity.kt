/**
 * #869 THE density declaration of the Store - Cloud Store's screens and every
 * libs:appstore shelf, row, bar and sheet read their sizes from here and from
 * nowhere else (the #621 cloud-drive approach, DriveMetrics). The Store is a
 * data list, not a launcher: rows are compact, the type ramp is small, buttons
 * are not Material's 48dp boxes.
 *
 * No other Kotlin file of the Store holds a dp or sp literal: spacing is one of
 * the steps below, type is one of the T_* ramp entries, and a fixed box is a
 * named size. Change the feel of the whole Store by editing this file only.
