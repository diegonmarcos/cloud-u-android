 * #896 Which child page of a Store section is showing, and who draws the strip for it.
 *
 * Cloud Store declares child pages in build.json::ui (Phone: installed | declared, Feed:
 * commits | cicd) and its host draws them with libs:bottomnav's PageTabs, then calls [select].
 * A host that does NOT draw them (SuperApp's embedded Store) leaves [hostDrawsStrip] false and
 * the fragment draws the same pages itself with [StoreTabs], the strip Cloud already wears. (View-free on purpose: the page frame and the strip builder live in StoreBar.kt.)
 * Either way the fragment reads the page from here, so there is one state and one meaning.
