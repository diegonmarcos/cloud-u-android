/**
 * The client of the DECISIONS ENGINE (#881): the OpenRouter token, the budget, the consent, the answer
 * cache and the call itself live in Cloud-Lib-Decisions-Engine.apk, so an app that asks a decision model
 * something holds NO KEY and an edit to how it is asked republishes that APK and no app.
 *
 *     val v = DecisionsLink.decide(context, "writer_route", state, questions) ?: return todaysBehaviour()
 *
 * ABSENT, OLD, REFUSED OR BROKEN ENGINE = NO OPINION. [decide] answers null for everything that is not an
 * answer (no engine installed, a contract below the needed one, no consent, offline, over budget, a
 * timeout, a malformed reply) and never throws; [outcome] keeps the reason for a screen that wants to say
 * why. The app's own path is the fallback, always, and a use's static deny list runs before this call.
 *
 * THE HANDSHAKE COMES FIRST AND COSTS NO BIND: it resolves the declared action in the declared package
 * (engine-client.json, resolved from the fleet manifest at build time and queried in this module's
 * manifest) and reads the CONTRACT it declares. THE ENGINE IS BOUND ONLY FOR THE CALL.
 *
 * Blocking: call from a background thread.
