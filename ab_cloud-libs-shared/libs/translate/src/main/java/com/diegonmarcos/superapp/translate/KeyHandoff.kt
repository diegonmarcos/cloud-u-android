/**
 * WHO OWNS THE KEYSTROKES — the bar's own box, or the host application's field.
 *
 * While a bar is open its box holds the keys: LatinIME routes printable keys, backspace,
 * the editing keys and the caret gestures into [TextBoxEditor] instead of into the field
 * behind the bar. That capture is #87 and it is not in question here. What this class adds
 * is the way OUT of it, which #355 part 2 decided: **tapping into the host application's
 * own text field releases the keys back to it.** No new gesture, because that is what
 * every IME panel on the platform already does and the instinctive action should be the
 * one that works.
 *
 * THE ONLY SIGNAL AN IME GETS FOR "THE USER MOVED THE CARET THEMSELVES" is
 * `onUpdateSelection`, and it does not say who caused it. The bar's own writes to the
 * host field produce one too, so a release on every selection change hands the keys back
 * the instant the user types into the panel — which is the whole feature, gone.
 *
 * SO THE DISCRIMINATOR IS DECLARED, NOT INFERRED. Every write the bar makes to the host
 * field announces itself with [onSelfWrite] first, and the echo that comes back is spent
 * against that announcement rather than read as a takeover. This is the SAME rule the
 * live-commit ownership state machine already ran on — `releaseOutput` sets
 * `Output.NONE` before its InputConnection calls precisely so the guard swallows its own
 * echo — widened from that one call site to every one of them. It is not a second,
 * rival distinction.
 *
 * WHY IT COULD NOT JUST REUSE `Output`. `Output.OWNED` only ever exists in live-commit
 * mode, so with live commit off the ownership machine never leaves `NONE` and would have
 * classified nothing at all. Key ownership also has to outlive text ownership in the
 * other direction: after a host tap the bar must stop writing to the field FOREVER
 * (`Output.LOST` is terminal, and stays terminal) while still being allowed to take the
 * keys back when the user taps the panel again. One flag cannot say both things.
 *
 * WHY NOT `RichInputConnection.isBelatedExpectedUpdate`. That is AOSP's answer to this
 * exact question and it is in this tree, but the bar is bound to the RAW
 * `InputConnection` from `getCurrentInputConnection()`, not to `mConnection`. Its
 * expected-position tracking never sees the bar's writes and would report every one of
 * them as unexpected — the wrong answer, confidently.
 *
 * No Android imports, on purpose: this is the part whose correctness is worth executing,
 * and keeping it free of the view layer is what lets a test compile and RUN it without a
 * device. `libs/` carries engines, and this is one.
