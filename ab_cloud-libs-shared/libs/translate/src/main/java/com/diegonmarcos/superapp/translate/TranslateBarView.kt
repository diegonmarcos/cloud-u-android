/**
 * Translate bar, hosted INSIDE the keyboard frame (LatinIME adds it above the
 * suggestion strip; onComputeInsets reserves its height so the host app
 * reflows up):
 *
 *   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
 *   │ [AUTO (EN) ▾]   ⇄   [PT ▾]              ✕  │  language chips (tap = picker, recents first)
 *   │ type here…                                 │  input buffer (keys are routed here by LatinIME)
 *   │ tradução ao vivo                           │  live preview / status line
 *   │ [Insert] [Replace] [Copy] [Clear]          │  actions — Enter = the primary one (setting)
 *   └───────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * Input model: while the bar is open, LatinIME routes printable keys, backspace,
 * the editing keys and the caret-slide GESTURES into [editor] — the shared
 * [TextBoxEditor] the enhance bar's box uses too; nothing touches the app field
 * until the user applies (Insert at cursor / Replace selection-or-field / Copy).
 *
 * Live commit (on by default) additionally streams the translation into the app
 * field as you type. Two buffers then exist — [editor] and the host's field — and
 * [Output] is the rule that keeps them from fighting: the bar's buffer is always
 * the user's, the bar owns exactly ONE span of the host field, it owns that span
 * as a composing region so the platform tracks it, and it gives the span up the
 * moment the host says otherwise. [onHostOutputDropped] carries the argument for
 * why that arrangement cannot loop.
 *
 * EMOJI ACROSS THE ROUND TRIP: THEY PASS THROUGH, AND THAT IS A DECISION.
 * A translation provider may drop, duplicate, reorder or re-render the emoji in a
 * sentence, because emoji are not language and nothing in a translation model is
 * asked to preserve them. So the text coming back differs from the text that went
 * out in ways that have nothing to do with translation quality. Three answers were
 * possible and two lose:
 *
 *   - Treat an emoji-only difference as "the source changed" and re-sync. This is
 *     the one that produces the flaky box: it makes a difference the provider will
 *     reintroduce on the very next request into a reason to make another request.
 *     There is deliberately NO comparison anywhere here between what was sent and
 *     what came back — [onChanged]'s only equality test is source against source,
 *     to drop a reply that a later keystroke has already made stale.
 *   - Extract the emoji before sending and re-insert them after. The known failure
 *     is that the placeholder tokens get translated or mangled themselves, and
 *     there is a second one specific to translation: a target language with a
 *     different word order has no defined position to put an emoji back into. It
 *     would also mean changing what the translation call sends, which is not this
 *     layer's to change.
 *   - Pass them through untouched, and make the box arithmetic correct enough that
 *     an emoji in the SOURCE survives being typed, moved past and deleted. That is
 *     what [TextBoxEditor] is for, and it is what this bar does.
 *
 * Settings + recent pairs: [TranslatePrefs]. Engine: [Translator].
 * Lives in libs:translate; the cloud-keyboard tree (libs/keyboard) hosts it in LatinIME.
