# Build the firestack netstack aar that libs:firewall consumes.
#
# This lives WITH the module, not inside one consumer, because libs:firewall has
# two of them: aa_cloud-superapp (which compiles it into Cloud-SuperApp.apk) and
# ab_cloud-libs-shared/lib-apks (which ships it as Cloud-Lib-Firewall.apk). The
# build step used to exist only in the superapp's build.sh, so lib-apks could
# never produce the aar — which is why the dependency could not be declared in
# libs/firewall/build.gradle without breaking ship-cloud-libs. One script, both
# callers, no duplicated Go/gomobile logic to drift.
#
# ENV-AGNOSTIC BY DESIGN: it assumes it is ALREADY running wherever ANDROID_HOME
# and an NDK are visible. Each caller wraps it in its own devShell
# (`in_nix bash build-firestack.sh`), because the superapp resolves that through
# its flake while lib-apks runs under BYPASS_NIX=1 with the SDK the CI action
# installed. Baking either assumption in here would break the other.

# SEED, then BUILD OFFLINE. These two steps are the whole reason this build is
# reproducible, and they must stay in this order.
#
# Dependency resolution happens HERE, once, and only against the committed
# go.mod/go.sum: `go mod download` verifies every module against the checksums
# in go.sum and refuses anything that does not match. Nothing is resolved
# afterwards. The build itself then runs with GOPROXY=off, so it can only use
# what these pins delivered — a dependency the pins do not cover fails loudly
# with "module lookup disabled by GOPROXY=off" instead of being silently
# fetched from the network mid-build.
#
# Why this matters: `gomobile bind` shells out to `go mod tidy` in a throwaway
# module it synthesises per ABI (x/mobile cmd/gomobile/bind_androidapp.go, the
# goModTidyAt call after writeGoMod). That temp module has no go.sum, so tidy
# re-derives the ENTIRE dependency graph on every build. Three APK publishes
# were lost in one day to sum.golang.org returning a stream error partway
# through that, each time on a different module. Seeding first is what stops
# the aar depending on a third-party service being healthy.
# NOT `go mod download all`: the `all` pattern walks the test dependencies of
# dependencies, and to record them it WRITES new hashes into go.sum — a build
# step quietly editing the pins it is supposed to be constrained by, which is
# the same class of bug as the tidy. Bare `go mod download` covers what this
# module builds, verifies it against the committed go.sum, and leaves both files
# byte-identical.

# The seed above covers the modules go.mod REQUIRES. It cannot cover a build
# tool go.mod deliberately does not require, and the Makefile installs exactly
# one of those: `go install github.com/felixge/go-patch-overlay@$(GOPATCHOVERLAY_VERSION)`
# in the $(GOMOBILE) recipe. That install was therefore the one piece of
# resolution still happening INSIDE the GOPROXY=off build, where it could only
# fail — "module lookup disabled by GOPROXY=off", exit 2, no aar, no APK. It was
# invisible while the tool was `@latest` on a runner whose module cache happened
# to carry it; pinning the version did not put it in the cache, it only made the
# gap deterministic. Seeded here, with the proxy still on, by the same rule as
# every other module: resolve once, then resolve nothing.
# SEED THE BINARIES, NOT JUST THE MODULES — AND INTO THE GOBIN THE MAKEFILE NAMES.
#
# Seeding the module cache was necessary and not sufficient, and runs
# 34462765453 / 34464514365 are what proved it. The $(GOMOBILE) recipe installs
# BOTH build tools into its own GOBIN ($SRC/bin), and that recipe runs INSIDE the
# GOPROXY=off build. `go install pkg@version` does not stop at the module cache:
# before it builds anything it asks the proxy whether that module is DEPRECATED,
# and with the proxy off the only answer available is
#
#     loading deprecation for github.com/felixge/go-patch-overlay:
#     module lookup disabled by GOPROXY=off
#
# The seed above put the module in the cache and then installed the binary into
# the DEFAULT GOBIN, which is not the directory the Makefile looks in — so the
# recipe ran anyway and died on the deprecation lookup, with the aar unbuilt and
# the owner's phone left on an APK from 2026-09-09.
#
# The invariant is unchanged and is now actually enforced: resolve once, here,
# with the proxy up; resolve NOTHING inside the offline build. The way to get
# there is to leave the recipe with nothing left to do. make rebuilds
# $(GOMOBILE) only when bin/gomobile is missing or older than go.mod, so seeding
# both binaries into $SRC/bin means the target is already up to date and the
# recipe never executes — no `go install` runs under GOPROXY=off because no
# command runs there at all.
#
# gomobile itself carries no @version (it resolves through go.mod), which is why
# its install was the one surviving the offline build; it is seeded here anyway
# so that bin/gomobile EXISTS, which is the whole mechanism.

# SEED WHAT GOMOBILE RESOLVES FOR ITSELF, NOT JUST WHAT THIS MODULE BUILDS.
#
# Everything above seeds the modules THIS module builds. `gomobile bind` does
# not build the aar from this module's dependency graph, and it resolves twice
# more on its own — both times INSIDE the GOPROXY=off build:
#
#   1. getModuleVersions (x/mobile cmd/gomobile/bind.go:229-243) runs
#      `go list -m -json -tags=<tags> all` in THIS directory to learn the
#      versions it should write into the throwaway module it synthesises per
#      ABI. `go list -m all` walks the whole module GRAPH — it needs the go.mod
#      of every module in it, not only the ones this module builds — so a cache
#      seeded by bare `go mod download` does not satisfy it. Measured on a cache
#      seeded exactly that way: 80 lookups, every one refused.
#
#   2. goModTidyAt (cmd/gomobile/bind_androidapp.go:383) then runs `go mod tidy`
#      inside that throwaway module, whose go.mod is a FLAT require list. MVS
#      re-runs there without this module's graph pruning and can select HIGHER
#      versions than we pin — measured: testify v1.9.0 in the flat list pulls
#      stretchr/objx v0.5.2, where this module's own graph never goes past objx
#      v0.1.0. A version we do not pin is by definition not in a cache seeded
#      from our pins.
#
# When (1) fails, gomobile does not say so. bind.go:240-243 turns the error into
# `return nil, nil`, and writeGoMod (bind.go:318-325) treats that nil as "no
# module info" and writes a ZERO-BYTE go.mod. The build then dies in (2) with
#
#     go: error reading go.mod: missing module declaration
#
# which names neither GOPROXY nor the module that was missing, and points at a
# file gomobile itself had just emptied. That is the failure that broke every
# Cloud SuperApp publish from 2026-09-09 17:14 onward: the offline seeding was
# right in intent and incomplete in fact, and the incompleteness was invisible.
#
# So resolve both HERE, with the proxy still up, by the same rule as every other
# module: resolve once, then resolve nothing. Neither step may touch the
# committed pins — asserted below rather than assumed.
