/**
 * SuperApp addition — THE PROMPT, shown where the settings that build it are.
 *
 * Every AI feature on this device sends a system prompt the user never saw, assembled out of a
 * preamble and whichever menu entries they picked. Until this row, "Polish tone and flow" was the
 * whole of what a person could know about what their text was going to be told to become. A
 * feature whose behaviour is a paragraph of English should show that paragraph.
 *
 * AND IT IS THE REASON THE PROMPTS ARE DATA. This row can only exist because the prompts live in
 * build.json::keyboard_ai and are read through [AiRouter]; a prompt written as a Kotlin literal
 * inside the code that sends it cannot be displayed without a second copy of the same words in the
 * screen, and the day the two disagree the screen is lying about what the app does. So: if a
 * prompt can be shown in Settings, it is configuration, and it belongs in the registry.
 *
 * READ-ONLY, and composed exactly as the engine composes it — [text] is passed in already built by
 * the same function the feature calls, never re-assembled here. Copyable, because the useful thing
 * to do with a prompt you disagree with is paste it somewhere and say so.
