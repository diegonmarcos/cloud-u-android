/**
 * The ONE model of what the input view is showing (#843). Cloud Keyboard addition, not upstream.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Which of the input view's pieces is visible used to be decided by whichever
 * method ran last: KeyboardSwitcher.setMainKeyboardFrame / setEmojiKeyboard /
 * setClipboardKeyboard / onToggleKeyboard each wrote its own list of setVisibility calls,
 * "which panel is open" was answered by asking a View whether it isShown(), the clipboard
 * panel built its close key ONCE in its constructor from the settings of that instant, and the
 * #776 toolbar self-heal ran on every start without knowing a panel was open. A config change
 * while the keyguard was locked (SettingsValues: toolbar HIDDEN, secondary strip hidden)
 * re-inflated a clipboard panel with ZERO strip keys - no CLOSE_HISTORY, for the life of that
 * input view - and #776 then healed the toolbar row back, making the clipboard key reachable
 * again and dropping the user into a panel that had lost its way out.
 *
 * Now: KeyboardSwitcher holds one [KeyboardViewState]; every transition changes [mode] here
 * and then calls its single applyViewState(), which renders [plan] onto the views. Nothing else
 * may toggle those views (test-keyboard-view-state-exit.sh enforces it). The invariant, checked
 * by KeyboardViewStateTest for every mode and every settings combination:
 *
 *     every non-typing state renders at least one visible, working exit
 *     (the panel's close key and/or the bottom-row ABC key), and system back
 *     and the panel's own toolbar key both lead back to [Mode.Typing].
 *
 * Pure Kotlin on purpose (no android.* imports): the whole decision is JVM-testable.
