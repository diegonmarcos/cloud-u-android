/**
 * SuperApp addition — "Text Enhancements": send the selection (or the whole field)
 * through [AiRouter] with the configured style prompt and replace it with the reply.
 * Triggered by the ENHANCE toolbar key; [GrammarChecker] mode "ai" reuses it with the
 * "grammar" style.
 *
 * What gets rewritten is [Settings.PREF_ENHANCE_SCOPE]: "auto" (the selection when there
 * is one, otherwise the whole field), "selection", or "field".
 *
 * Interaction = GrammarChecker's family: the improved text is committed in place and
 * carries a [SuggestionSpan] holding the ORIGINAL, so the field underlines it and a tap
 * offers the one-tap revert. Progress/failure are Toasts (the IME has no other surface
 * that survives the field losing focus).
 *
 * Cancel-on-new-input: each run takes a sequence number; a reply is dropped if a newer
 * run started, or if the field text changed while the model was thinking.
