/**
 * Serves [ITextTools] out of the app that owns the Text tools.
 *
 * THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE MODULE. The two engines and their settings stay in
 * one process — this one. A sibling app asking for a rewrite does not link AiRouter,
 * does not read the routing prefs, and above all never receives the provider key: the
 * key is read here, spent here on one HTTPS request, and only the resulting TEXT
 * crosses the binder. There is no second copy of the credential path because there is
 * no second holder of the credential.
 *
 * ONE ENGINE, SEVERAL SETS OF SETTINGS — and the two halves of that sentence are why this
 * class has two families of methods.
 *
 * [enhance], [translate] and [summarise] resolve the prompt, the model and the translation
 * target out of THIS app's preferences. They are what the keyboard's own surfaces need, and
 * for a while they were all a sibling app had, which made this app the only owner of every
 * one of those settings: cloud-mail's Text pages could only ever be the keyboard's pages,
 * and the owner could look at their mail settings without being able to change any of them.
 *
 * [enhanceWith] and [summariseWith] take the prompt and the model FROM THE CALLER. An app
 * that holds its own copy of the registry and its own preferences sends its decision and
 * gets its own rewrite. What it still does not get, and what makes the split safe, is the
 * engine: the HTTP call, the chunking, the summary budget, the bullet enforcement, the error
 * wording and the API KEY all stay here in one copy. Duplicating settings is what the owner
 * asked for; duplicating the credential path is what this module exists to prevent, and the
 * two are not the same request.
 *
 * ROUTING, AND IT MUST NOT BE CROSSED:
 *   [enhance]/[enhanceWith]     -> AiRouter / TextEnhancer  — the OpenRouter-shape provider.
 *   [summarise]/[summariseWith] -> AiRouter                 — the SAME provider, another prompt.
 *   [translate]                 -> Translator / TranslateEngines — the translation library.
 * The LLM pair and the translator may never reach each other's engine. They cost different money,
 * they answer differently, and a caller cannot tell from a reply which one produced it.
 * [enhance] and [summarise] deliberately DO share an engine: they are one feature's plumbing asked
 * two questions, and a second copy of the routing and credential path for the second question is
 * the duplication this whole module exists to prevent.
 *
 * Access is decided entirely by the manifest: the service is exported under
 * [TextTools.PERMISSION], declared `signature`, so the platform turns away any caller
 * not signed with the Cloud key before a line of this class runs. No uid check here —
 * re-implementing what the package manager already enforces, worse, is how those
 * checks come to disagree.
 *
 * Binder transactions arrive on a pool thread, never the main one, which is what makes
 * calling the blocking engines directly correct here.

         *    Enhance styles. Mixing the two menus would offer "improve this" to a feature that
         *    promises "shorten this".
         *  - it goes through AiRouter.summarise rather than TextEnhancer.rewrite. rewrite() splits
         *    input past the provider's budget and rejoins the answers, which for a rewrite is right
         *    and for a summary is exactly wrong: it produces a summary PER PIECE, concatenated, and
         *    a "summary" longer than the mail it was made from.
         *
         * NOTHING OF THE SUMMARY IS DECIDED HERE. The budget, the truncation note and the check
         * that a reply asked for bullets came back as bullets all live in AiRouter.summarise, which
         * the keyboard's own Text Resume bar also calls directly. That is what makes cloud-mail's
         * AI Resume and the keyboard's Text Resume the same feature rather than two features that
         * agree today: this method contributes the binder, and not one rule about summarising.
