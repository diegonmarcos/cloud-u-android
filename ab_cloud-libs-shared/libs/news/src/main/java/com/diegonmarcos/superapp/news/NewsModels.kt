 *  - a FIXED rss source (bbc-world, guardian-world, dw-en, hackernews,
 *    ...) declares its channels literally in data/sources.json's
 *    `channels` array — [url] is that declared sub-feed's URL.
 *  - a QUERY-DRIVEN source (gdelt-self, google-news) carries NO
 *    `channels` in sources.json at all; [NewsBridge] synthesizes one
 *    channel per entry in the user's live topics store (baked +
 *    custom, in effective order), each channel's [id] equal to that
 *    topic's id — see NewsBridge.channelsForSource. [url] is unused
 *    (blank) for a synthesized channel: the query template lives on
 *    the parent [NewsSourceConfig.url] instead.
 *  - a DYNAMIC-CHANNEL source (ntfy-self) also carries no `channels`
 *    in sources.json — its channels are discovered at runtime from
 *    [NewsSourceConfig.channelsUrl] (see [DynamicChannels]), cached on
 *    disk (NewsStore's DynamicChannelStore), and re-discovered on
 *    every sync. [url] here IS meaningful: it's that discovered
 *    channel's own feed URL.
 *
 * [group] is optional and ONLY ever set by [DynamicChannels] parsing a
 * discovery payload that itself carried a group/category field — a
 * declared or synthesized channel never sets it. Lets a UI section a
 * large dynamic channel list (e.g. ntfy-self's ~142 channels) without
 * this app inventing groups the source data never provided. For the
 * real rss-gateway `channels.json` shape (see [DynamicChannels]) it is
 * DERIVED from [path] (every segment but the leaf), not read as its
 * own field — the payload has no separate group/category field at all.
 *
 * [path] is the discovery payload's full slash-separated hierarchy
 * (e.g. `"Cloud-Infra/CICD/GH"`) verbatim, ONLY ever set by
 * [DynamicChannels] from a real `path` field — kept alongside the
 * derived [group] because it is strictly more information (the whole

 * — `title` (not `label`/`name`) is the display name, `path` is the
 * full slash-separated folder hierarchy (leaf included; see
 * [NewsChannelConfig.path]/[groupFromPath]), `feed` is the per-topic
 * ATOM url and may be ORIGIN-RELATIVE (resolved against the payload's

 * of silently trusted.
