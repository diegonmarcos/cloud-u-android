/**
 * Getting a shell channel, rather than just reporting that there isn't one.
 *
 * [ShellChannels.active] answers "is one ready?" — useful for a status line,
 * useless for a button. A button that needs SHELL privilege should START the
 * flow that grants it, so this walks the ladder from "nothing installed" up to
 * "ready" and takes the one action that moves the user forward.
 *
 * The ladder is INTERNAL FIRST, matching [ShellChannels.all]:
 *   1. a channel that is already live;
 *   2. the app's own embedded adb client, reconnected over mDNS with the keys
 *      from its one-time pairing — self-contained, no other app, no user step;
 *   3. the external Shizuku app, if it happens to be installed and running;
 *   4. an honest "unavailable", saying what each plane needs.

     * the user approves the Shizuku prompt — so the caller can finish the job it
     * was already attempting. It lands on a binder thread; marshal to the UI
     * thread yourself. It is not called when the user must act elsewhere first
