/**
 * Turns off the Play Protect install-time scan prompt — the
 * "Scan app with Play Protect? / Install without scanning" dialog that
 * interrupts every fleet install on a GMS device.
 *
 * That dialog is NOT something an installer can opt out of: no manifest
 * flag, no signature, no F-Droid-style repo index suppresses it. It is
 * driven by three Settings.Global values that GmsCore's package verifier
 * reads, and writing them needs WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS — a signature
 * permission no sideloaded APK can hold. Hence the shell channel: the
 * SHELL uid (2000) holds it, so `settings put global …` through
 * [ShellChannels] does what the app itself cannot.
 *
 * READING is unprivileged, so [state] works with no channel at all and the
 * UI can always show the truth. Only [setScanning] needs a channel.
 *
 * This is device state, not app state: it survives SuperApp being
 * uninstalled, and it applies to EVERY installer on the device. Flipping
 * it back is the same one call.
