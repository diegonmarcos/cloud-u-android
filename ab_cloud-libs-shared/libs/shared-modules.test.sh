#      is exactly how the split first broke: isAlwaysOn/isLockdownEnabled were

# 16. EVERY install path must be serialised, not just the fleet batch.
#     PackageInstaller.commit() hands the session over and returns, so any two
#     callers that start installs on their own threads run concurrently:
#     colliding sessions, stacked confirm dialogs, and sessions piling up
#     against Android's 50-session cap. The Constellation list's per-row button
#     spawns a thread per tap and never went through the batch, which is how
#     three taps started three installs at once.
#     The guarantee therefore lives in UpdateInstaller.install - the one place
#     every caller passes through - so a new call site cannot forget it.
# Scoped by PACKAGE path, not bare filename: cloud-ide has its own
# UpdateInstaller.kt and the Fossify dialer fork vendors another, so
# `find -name` + head -1 picks whichever the walk hits first. The constellation
# installer is the one in com/diegonmarcos/superapp/updater/. Every match is
# checked, so a vendored copy reappearing is caught rather than masked. A miss
# FAILS — this rule sat disarmed through the 2026-08 libs-shared move because a
# `[ -f <stale path> ]` guard turned it into a no-op.

#     Apps|Admin facets. Also covers swipe_walk's section+page pairs and
#     home_groups' tiles_from_section (including its "<section>/<page>" form).
