/**
 * Battery capacity reader — surfaces the RATED (nameplate / design)
 * capacity and the CURRENT-FULL (aged) capacity, each in mAh plus a
 * derived Watt-hour figure.
 *
 * Why a dedicated reader: Android exposes NO public API for design
 * capacity, and on hardened Samsung One UI 7 the sysfs
 * `/sys/class/power_supply/battery/charge_full_design` node is
 * SELinux-blocked (see EnergyUsageDialog — "Design isn't exposed by
 * Android"). The reliable cross-device path is the hidden framework
 * PowerProfile.getBatteryCapacity() via reflection — the same trick
 * AccuBattery uses — which returns design capacity in mAh and is
 * permission-free on virtually every device, Samsung included. It can
 * still return null on the newest hidden-API-hardened builds; we then
 * fall back to sysfs and finally render "—".
 *
 * Watt-hour is computed as mAh × [NOMINAL_VOLTAGE_V] (single-cell
 * Li-ion nominal = 3.85 V). We deliberately do NOT read sysfs
 * `energy_full` (also usually blocked) nor the live voltage (it swings
 * 3.3–4.4 V and would make the Wh figure jump every read) — a fixed
 * nominal keeps the number stable and consistent with how capacity is
 * rated on the spec sheet.
 *
 * KDoc gotcha (same as SysfsProc.kt): never
 * write a literal slash-star inside this block comment — Kotlin block
 * comments are nested-aware, so it would open a nested comment and
 * swallow the rest of the file. Use `...` or `<node>` as placeholders.
