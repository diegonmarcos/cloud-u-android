/**
 * Manifest-registered receiver for the EXACT moment the device is plugged in
 * or unplugged, whether or not the SuperApp is running: it records one battery
 * SoT sample ([BatteryRepository.record]), so the plug/unplug boundary in the
 * history — where a discharge cycle ends and a charge session begins, and what
 * "since last charge" counts from — is the real moment, not the next tick.
 *
 * ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED / ACTION_POWER_DISCONNECTED are exempt from the
 * Android 8+ implicit-broadcast manifest restriction, so they arrive with the
 * app cold. ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED is deliberately NOT manifest-registered
 * (sticky and frequent); the recorder reads the sticky intent once instead.
