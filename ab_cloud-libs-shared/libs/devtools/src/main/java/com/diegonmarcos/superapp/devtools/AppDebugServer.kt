/**
 * The constellation-wide debug API: a loopback HTTP surface that EVERY app
 * gets, not just the ones someone remembered to wire it into.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * An app can always read its OWN logcat with no permission at all — Android
 * filters logcat by uid, and READ_LOGS (needed to see anyone else's) is
 * signature|privileged against the PLATFORM key, which our shared Cloud
 * signing key is not. So no amount of constellation signing lets the SuperApp
 * read cloud-news's logs from outside. The only way to get an app's logs is
 * for that app to serve them itself. Hence: this ships in libs:devtools, which
 * libs:core exposes via `api`, so every app that links core answers on
 * loopback with zero per-app code.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the same thing as the app-owned DevControlServer
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * SuperApp and cloud-nav each own a big DevControlServer on port 38080 with
 * dozens of app-specific routes under nav, battery and adb. Those stay exactly
 * where they are — this binds a different port range and only serves the
 * handful of endpoints that need no app-specific types whatsoever. Extracting
 * those two servers is a separate job; this one had to be safe to drop into
 * eight apps at once.
 *
 * Auth: one [FleetToken] for the whole fleet, as `Authorization: Bearer <t>`,
 * on every route except /api/system/ping. Loopback alone is not a boundary
 * here — it is device-wide on Android, so any installed app holding INTERNET
 * can reach these ports — and it stopped being defensible entirely once app
 * data started riding these routes beside the logs. One token rather than one
 * per app because fifteen secrets to read one log is how a debug facility goes
 * unused: SuperApp mints it, siblings adopt it over a signature-guarded
 * provider, and the human reads it once from Configs → About.
 *
 * Port: the first free one in [PORT_FIRST, PORT_LAST]. Every app defaults to
 * the same number, so a fixed port would mean only whichever app started first
 * gets a server. A scanner walks the range and asks each port
 * /api/system/info who it is.
