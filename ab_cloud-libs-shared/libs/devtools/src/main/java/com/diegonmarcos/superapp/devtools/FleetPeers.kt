/**
 * Who else is on the mesh, and how to wake them.
 *
 * A member is any installed package shipping a devtools [FleetTokenProvider] —
 * the provider is the membership marker, so the list cannot drift out of sync
 * with a hardcoded roster the way a per-app manifest list would.
 *
 * Visibility note (#733): Android 11+ filters package queries, and a shared
 * signing certificate does NOT make two apps visible to each other — it is not
 * on the platform's automatic-visibility list. The earlier note here assumed it
 * was, so in every member without QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES this list held itself and
 * SuperApp and nothing else. Visibility now comes from the devtools manifest:
 * it queries the MESH_MEMBER action that every member's FleetMemberReceiver
 * answers, so the whole fleet is visible with no broad grant. If [list] ever
 * comes back shorter than the installed fleet, Apps Mesh ▸ Missing membership
 * names the member that is blind and the ones it cannot see.
