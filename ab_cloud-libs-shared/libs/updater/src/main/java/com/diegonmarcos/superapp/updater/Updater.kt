     *
     * THE ACK USED TO BE A LIE, AND IT COST FOUR PUBLISHED APKs.
     *
     * The server's handler for that route was, in full:
     *
     *     DevControlBridge.runOnMain {
     *         DevControlBridge.host()?.onActionFromServer("check_updates")
     *     }
     *     reply(writer, "200 OK", "update queued\n")
     *
     * and `DevControlBridge.host()` is a WeakReference that the launcher
     * Activity registers in onResume and clears in onPause. A fleet-driven
     * update arrives with the screen off and the app backgrounded — which is
     * the entire point of driving it remotely — so host() was null, the
     * safe-call discarded the whole request, and the server answered
     * "update queued" for work that had never been queued, never been looked
     * at, and never been logged. On 2026-09-16 that phone sat four releases
     * behind while 1200 lines of its own logcat held zero matches for
     * updat|install|download|apk: nothing had run, because nothing had been
     * asked to. Three Android tickets were closed on "published" and reopened
     * because "published" had stopped implying "installed" (#280, blocking
     * #260/#261/#267/#70).
     *
     * So the UI is out of the path. WorkManager is reachable from any thread
     * that has an application Context and does not care whether an Activity
     * exists, which is exactly the property the old path lacked. And the
     * answer is the outcome: [enqueueUserInitiated] hands back an [Operation],
     * this waits on it, and an enqueue that fails returns ok=false, logs at
     * ERROR and publishes [UpdateProgress.State.Failed] — a state
     * [UpdateProgress.suppressed] is documented never to hide, so it reaches
     * the screen even during an unattended pass. An updater that cannot update
     * now says why, on the device, in the log and on the display.
     *
     * Blocking is correct here and not an oversight: the debug server handles
     * each connection inline on its own accept-loop thread, never on the main
     * Looper, and a reply sent before the enqueue resolved would be the same
     * unverified optimism this method exists to delete.
