     *
     * This used to be a compile-time `ALLOW_PROMPTING_FALLBACK = false`, which
     * dropped SessionInstall for EVERY device in the fleet in order to suppress
     * a dialog on ONE developer's phone. One APK ships to thousands of devices,

     * they were left with no install path whatsoever — including no path to
     * receive the fix for it. Silence is an OPTIMISATION for capable devices,
     * never a PRECONDITION for updating.
     *
     * The suppression survives, but as what it always was: a per-device
     * preference ([AutoUpdatePrefs.requireSilent], default false) that the one
     * device with a live privileged channel can opt in to. It can only ever
     * subtract the fallback from the device whose owner asked for it, and it
