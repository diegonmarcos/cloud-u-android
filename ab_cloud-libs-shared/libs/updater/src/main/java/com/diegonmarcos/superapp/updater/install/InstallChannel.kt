     *  a chance to stack its scan prompt on top. This is the same channel the
     *  Play-Protect toggle already uses (adbdebug.PackageVerifier).
     *
     *  THE APK IS STREAMED, NEVER HANDED OVER AS A PATH.
     *
     *  This used to copy the APK into getExternalFilesDir() and run
     *  `pm install <path>`. uid 2000 cannot read that path: /Android/data is
     *  FUSE-restricted from Android 11 — and `pm` reports the failure on
     *  STDERR, which the adb `exec:` service does not carry. The observed
     *  result was the worst possible one: ZERO bytes of output and a hang
     *  until the exec timeout, once per app, after which every install fell
     *  through to the prompting fallback and the user saw a dialog with
     *  Wireless debugging switched on. Hence `pm install -S <size>`, which
     *  reads the package from stdin exactly as `adb install` does: nothing is
     *  shared with the shell through the filesystem, and nothing is left
     *  behind on shared storage. (/data/local/tmp is not an option either —
     *  0771 root:shell, so an untrusted_app cannot create anything in it.)
     *
     *  Any failure at all returns the reason, and the caller reports it — or,
     *  where the prompting fallback is still enabled, falls through to the
     *  PackageInstaller path.
     *
     *  Blocking (the transfer plus the commit, plus up to ~10s of mDNS if a
     *  reconnect is needed); callers are already off the main thread.
     *
     *  Not private: [com.diegonmarcos.superapp.updater.UpdateWorker]'s
     *  self-update takes this same rung first (#588). */
