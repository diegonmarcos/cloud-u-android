/**
 * THE FLOOR. Install an APK with ZERO privileged access.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 * Every other install path in this module needs something the device might not
 * have: [com.diegonmarcos.superapp.updater.install.ShellInstall] needs a live
 * shell channel (Shizuku or a paired embedded adb client), and the
 * PackageInstaller session path is currently disabled outright (see
 * `Fleet.ALLOW_PROMPTING_FALLBACK`). So a phone that has lost its privileged
 * channel cannot install anything — INCLUDING the build that would give it the
 * channel back. That is a terminal state reachable by doing nothing, and the
 * only escape was a human with a USB cable, which does not scale past one
 * device, let alone thousands.
 *
 * This path needs none of it. It hands a `content://` URI to the ordinary
 * Android package installer with `ACTION_VIEW`, which is the same thing a file
 * manager does when you tap an APK. The user sees the standard system
 * confirmation and nothing else. It is slower and noisier than the silent
 * path, and that is precisely why it is the FALLBACK and not the default —
 * but it cannot be taken away by a lost pairing.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT do
 * It does not download, and it does not verify. It CANNOT: the only way in is
 * [Fleet.download], which returns a
 * [com.diegonmarcos.superapp.updater.apk.VerifiedApk], and that type's
 * constructor is private with every factory ending at `ApkIntegrity`. So the
 * bytes handed to the system installer here carry exactly the same guarantee
 * (release sha256 sidecar, or GHCR layer digest, or declared length) as the
 * bytes handed to the privileged installer. There is no second downloader and
 * no weakened check — writing one would have meant duplicating the code this
 * deliberately reuses.
 *
 * ## FileProvider authority
 * `<applicationId>.updater.fileprovider`, declared in THIS module's manifest
 * rather than each app's. Every constellation app shares the
 * `com.diegonmarcos.*` package prefix and several of them link `libs:updater`,
 * so a hand-written authority is a collision waiting to happen — two installed
 * apps declaring the same provider authority makes the second one fail to
 * install at all. `${applicationId}` is unique by construction, and declaring
 * it once here means a new consumer cannot forget it or get it wrong.
