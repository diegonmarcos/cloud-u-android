/**
 * WorkManager job: check → (gate) → download → install. Scheduled by
 * Updater.start(). Runs at build.json::release.auto_update.interval_hours.
 *
 * Metered gate: when the Wi-Fi-only preference is on, a run on a metered
 * network (mobile data) does NOT download — it publishes UpdateAvailable
 * carrying the size, so the screen can ask. Only a run started with
 * KEY_CONSENTED=true (the "Update now" button, pressed against a size the user
 * has just been shown) downloads over metered. KEY_FORCE alone means a human
 * asked to LOOK: it ignores the Auto-update toggle and draws progress, and it
 * is deliberately NOT authority to spend mobile data.
