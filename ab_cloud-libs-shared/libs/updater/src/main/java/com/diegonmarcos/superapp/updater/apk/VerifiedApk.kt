/**
 * An APK that has been checked, carrying the evidence with it.
 *
 * ## Why this is a type and not a function
 * Every download used to return `File` and every installer used to take
 * `File`, so "verify before installing" was a convention each path
 * re-implemented — four downloads, three install entry points, four different
 * rules. One of them (the GitHub release path) guarded its only check with
 * `if (total > 0 …)`, so when the CDN omitted Content-Length the check turned
 * itself off and an unverified file went straight to the installer. Nothing
 * could notice, because a `File` looks exactly like every other `File`.
 *
 * The constructor is private and every factory ends at [ApkIntegrity]. An
 * installer takes a [VerifiedApk], so installing something unchecked is not a
 * bug you can write — it is a program that does not compile.
 *
 * [evidence] is one line naming what was actually proven, so a log or the
 * Diagnose screen can say WHICH guarantee this APK has rather than implying
 * they are all equal. They are not: a digest match means these are the exact
 * published bytes; a size match means only that nothing was lost in transit.
