/**
 * Cloud config-artifact fetcher — the network half of
 * Configs → Profile → "OWebAuth Authelia Authentication · Auto Import Configs".
 *
 * Engine only: no `R`, no Fragment, no prefs. It does exactly one thing —
 * GET the artifact with a user-supplied credential and turn every failure
 * mode into a NAMED [Kind] instead of a blank state. The caller (app/) owns
 * the dialog and the apply step.
 *
 * FOUR IMPORT ROUTES, ONE CLIENT. Configs → Profile offers a pasted Authelia
 * bearer, an Authelia browser login, a GitHub login and a GitHub SSH key —
 * but three of those are the same GET with a different header, so they all
 * land in [request] and inherit one failure taxonomy. Only the SSH route is
 * genuinely different (it speaks git, not HTTP) and lives in the app module.
 *
 * Authelia auth is deliberately credential-in-a-header, NOT an in-app OAuth
 * dance: the token or session cookie is validated server-side by the existing
 * introspect-proxy / `@bearer` gate in front of the endpoint. So there is no
 * client secret here, no redirect URI, and nothing to keep in sync with
 * Authelia's client config.
 *
 * SECRET HYGIENE — the token must never reach a log or a diagnostic file:
 *  • the Authorization header value is never logged;
 *  • [redact] scrubs the token out of any server-supplied error body before
 *    it is logged or shown, in case the endpoint echoes it back.
 *
 * Diagnose with:  adb logcat -s ConfigSync
