/**
 * Execs the bundled static gh. The binary lives where the installer put it —
 * applicationInfo.nativeLibraryDir/libgh.so — because that is the one place an
 * app may exec from on API 29+ (see data/gh-binary.json). Blocking; callers run
 * it on IO.
 *
 * SELF-CONTAINED, MEASURED. A real authenticated `gh api /user` round-trip
 * spawned ZERO child processes: no git, no PATH, nothing from `$HOME`. So the
 * environment below is built from nothing rather than inherited — [GH_CONFIG_DIR]
 * points gh's whole config and state tree at the app's own files, and `HOME` is
 * pointed at the same place so a gh that ever consults it cannot reach outside
 * the sandbox.
 *
 * THE TOKEN NEVER APPEARS IN AN ARGUMENT OR IN OUTPUT WE KEEP. It is passed in
 * the environment as `GH_TOKEN`, which keeps it out of argv (and therefore out
 * of /proc/<pid>/cmdline, out of any process listing and out of every log line
 * this class produces). Nothing here calls `gh auth token`, which would print it
 * to stdout; nothing here renders, toasts or logs it, whole or truncated.
 *
 * #689 gh IS THE GITHUB LEG. [login] runs gh's OWN `auth login` (gh's device flow,
 * against the client id GitHub CLI compiles into this binary — the fleet supplies no
 * client id, no secret and no redirect), [status] reads who gh is signed in as,
 * [repoList] lists that account's repositories and [credential] hands the clone the
 * credential gh holds, through gh's own git-credential helper. gh keeps that
 * credential in [configDir], the app's private files.
 *
 * THE SANDBOX IS NOT A LINUX BOX: no /etc/resolv.conf and no /etc/ssl. [start] hands gh the CA
 * directories (SSL_CERT_DIR) and a loopback CONNECT proxy that resolves with Android's resolver
 * (HTTPS_PROXY → [GhNetProxy]); without them gh died on its first lookup and printed "check your
 * internet connection" (data/gh-binary.json::_doc_sandbox).
 *
 * EVERY gh RUN IS LOGGED under [TAG]: its verb, its exit, and on failure gh's own last words.
 * The device-flow lines are logged as gh prints them (a one-time code is shown on screen anyway).
 * The credential never is: [credential] logs whether gh answered, never what.
