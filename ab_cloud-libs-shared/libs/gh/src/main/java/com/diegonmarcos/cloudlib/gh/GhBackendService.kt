/**
 * #705 libs:gh AS AN ENGINE. gh runs HERE — inside Cloud-Lib-Gh.apk, in that APK's own
 * process and uid — behind core's IDataBackend, and an app that wants GitHub binds this
 * service instead of compiling gh in. Cloud Drive carried the 39 MB binary itself until
 * #705, so every gh bump republished Cloud Drive; now it republishes this one APK.
 *
 * WHERE gh's STATE LIVES: [GhRunner.configDir] is this APK's own files, so the sign-in gh
 * keeps belongs to the engine, and every fleet app that binds it shares that one GitHub
 * sign-in. The uid is also why gh can be an engine at all: it reads and writes no shared
 * storage. rclone and git-sync do, which is why they are not engines (a0_docs/eng-specs/
 * engine-apk-split.md).
 *
 * THE CONTRACT is [methodNames] plus the JSON each answers, versioned by the CONTRACT
 * meta-data on this service in the manifest. It only GROWS: a method is never removed or
 * re-shaped while a published client may call it — a change that would break an answer
 * ships under a new method name and raises the contract — so an engine update cannot
 * break an older app. A client reads the contract through PackageManager before it binds,
 * so an engine too old to serve it is named as such instead of reading like a missing one.
 *
 * THE CREDENTIAL CROSSES THE BINDER, deliberately: [CREDENTIAL] hands a clone the
 * credential gh holds, as GhRunner.credential did in-process. The service is guarded by
 * CONSTELLATION_DATA (signature-level), so only APKs signed with the fleet key can ask.
 * Nothing here logs an answer.
 *
 * SIGN-IN IS POLLED, NOT STREAMED: `gh auth login` blocks until GitHub approves the code,
 * and a binder call must not. [LOGIN_START] starts it on a thread and returns at once;
 * [LOGIN_POLL] reports the one-time code and the page as gh prints them — read HERE, with
 * the pin's own patterns (GhOutput), so a client never parses gh's output — and gh's exit
 * once it ends. A running gh is never an error: only gh's own exit is a verdict.
 *
 * EVERY CALL IS LOGGED to logcat under GhRunner.TAG ("GhEngine"), so a sign-in that fails on a
 * phone can be read there: the call, gh's verb and exit, gh's own words on a failure, and each
 * tunnel the engine opened for gh. The phone once showed a failure while this process logged
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * Dispatch is an explicit `when`, not reflection, for the reason DataBackendService gives.
