/**
 * THE bottom nav of the fleet: one Compose declaration that every app renders (#565).
 *
 * This is a PORT of superapp's View-era CloudBottomNavView + bg_nav_island.xml +
 * bg_bottom_nav_item_checked.xml + color/bottom_nav_content.xml, not a wrapper around them.
 * No AndroidView, no View, no drawable: the old toolkit ends here. The geometry comes from this
 * module's res/values/dimens.xml, which ports the tokens that #462/#473/#477/#498 settled.
 *
 *  - #417 the island is a full pill (radius = height/2), so its ends are true semicircles, and
 *    every item is laid out inside it. Nothing overflows the capsule it sits in.
 *  - #462 the SELECTED item is a pill too. It wraps the icon AND the label (Telegram/Revolut
 *    style), light on the dark bar, and it is the only lit capsule. Selection is shown by that
 *    pill, not by a colour change.
 *  - #473 the end capsules are inset by exactly the capsule's vertical inset, so their arcs are
 *    concentric with the island's. The cells are equal weights, so spacing is even. The label
 *    sits bottom_nav_icon_label_gap below the icon.
 *  - #477 the bottom clearance is ONE dimen plus the live system-bar/display-cutout inset.
 *    The inset is READ (getBottom), never applied through windowInsetsPadding or
 *    consumeWindowInsets, so nothing else in the window loses it.
 *  - #532 [collapsed] drops the labels and leaves an icons-only bar. A Compose shell derives it
 *    from scrolling with [BottomNavCollapse]; a View shell with
 *    [BottomNavIslandView.collapseOnScrollIn], which #673 added after the View shells were found
 *    to be setting [collapsed] nowhere at all, leaving them permanently expanded. Both drivers
 *    decide with [collapseFor], so there is one rule and not one per host style.
 *    The island is fill only, with no stroke layer, so the visible edge IS
 *    the fill's edge. The collapse is ANIMATED by one progress value that shrinks each label's
 *    layout slot, so the bar shrinks with it, and the label carries no clip of its own: the
 *    only thing that hides it is the capsule's pill clip, so the hide line IS the oval edge and
 *    there is no second, rectangular bound for it to vanish at. Under Power Saving or with
 *    animations removed it snaps instead ([barMotionEnabled]).
 *  - #536 the island is bottom_nav_width_fraction (80%) of the width it is given, and it is
 *    centred, so 10% stays clear on each side.
 *  - ACCESSIBILITY. Every item is a Tab with its label (the icon's description while collapsed)
 *    and its selected state, inside a selectable group that carries collection info, so TalkBack
 *    reads "Mail, selected, Tab, 1 of 5". Keyboard / D-pad / switch focus draws a ring in the item's
 *    ink; touch never focuses an item, so a tapped island is pixel for pixel what it was.
 *    NavAccessibilityTest.
 *  - FIT, never scroll. Every item is always on screen ([planIsland]). A bar whose equal cells clear
 *    the full-size floor (48dp up to EQUAL_CELLS_BOTTOM items, bottom_nav_min_cell_width above) is
 *    drawn exactly as it always was. A more crowded bar first widens its island past 80% (down to
 *    bottom_nav_min_side_margin each side) until its cells reach the 48dp touch floor, then, only
 *    if that is still short, narrows its end insets (down to bottom_nav_min_end_inset); its icon,
 *    label and icon-label gap scale down with the cell to the bottom_nav_fit_* minimums. The
 *    capsule's vertical inset, its colours and the focus ring are untouched (the island draws no
 *    badge of its own), and the icon keeps its 24dp slot, so the touch target keeps its full height.
 *
 * The items are INJECTED as [BottomNavEntry]. The bar knows nothing about any app's menu.

 *  3. still short of 48dp: the end insets narrow toward [NavTokens.minEndInset] (the end arcs then
 *     stop being exactly concentric; the capsule's vertical inset does not change);
 *  4. the icon, the label and the icon-label gap scale with [scale], 1 at [fullSizeCell] down to 0
 *     at [NavTokens.fitMinCell] (the bottom_nav_fit_* sizes).
