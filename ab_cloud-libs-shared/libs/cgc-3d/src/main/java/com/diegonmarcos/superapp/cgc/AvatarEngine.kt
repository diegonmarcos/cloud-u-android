/**
 * An avatar creation engine: what a model source can be edited with. The editor asks the active engine which category kinds it
 * draws (a kind it lacks shows "coming soon") and which model formats it loads. Every engine is open source end to end: cgc.js
 * (three.js, @pixiv/three-vrm, GLTFLoader / FBXLoader, GLTFExporter) draws the scene, no proprietary SDK is involved.
 *
 * The pipeline (documented in the lib README and the ticket):
 *  1. [ModelFileEngine] ("model-file", shipping): the user's own GLB / glTF / FBX / VRM (for example a MetaPerson Creator export,
 *     converted offline by tools/ to a meshopt-compressed GLB). Edits: bundled clips and Mixamo-style retargeted clips, material
 *     colour swaps and tints, show/hide of named meshes (glasses, outfit parts), ARKit-style blendshapes. Body and head shape,
 *     hair and outfit swaps need parts the file does not carry.
 *  2. [VrmModularEngine] ("vrm-modular", the open-source creation path, not available yet): a CC0 VRM base body plus modular VRM
 *     parts (hair, outfits, accessories: VRoid Studio exports or CC0 parts) bound to the base skeleton, body shape via the base's
 *     blendshapes. When its parts library is bundled, [available] turns true and its extra kinds light up.
 *  3. AI on top of either: OpenRouterAvatar turns "describe your avatar" text into a configuration of declared options only.
