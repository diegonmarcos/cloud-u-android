 * SEPARATE BY THE PLATFORM, NOT BY A NAMING CONVENTION. These are cloud-writer's
 * SharedPreferences, in cloud-writer's data directory, under cloud-writer's user id. This
 * application declares no `sharedUserId`, no settings ContentProvider and no shared backup agent,
 * so Android itself is what keeps this store and the serving application's apart: there is no key
 * cloud-writer can write that the keyboard can read, and none it can read that the keyboard can
 * write. That is why the key names below can safely echo the keyboard's — same name, different
 * file, different application, no relationship.
 *
 * NO CREDENTIAL IS STORED HERE, AND THERE IS NO KEY FOR ONE. Choosing a model is a setting;
 * holding the account that pays for it is not. cloud-writer names a provider and a model and the
 * serving application spends the credential — which is exactly what `enhanceWith` and
 * `summariseWith` exist for. `settingsSnapshot()`, which [seedFromServingApp] reads, carries no
 * key by construction on the far side, so there is nothing arriving here to store even by
 * accident.
 *
 * @see WriterRegistry for the prompts and model lists these ids resolve against.
