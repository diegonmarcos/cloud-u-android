/**
 * The owner's four tools, and therefore WHICH ENGINE each one reaches.
 *
 * The pairing is the point of the enum. [ENHANCE], [GRAMMAR] and [SUMMARY] go to the
 * chat-completions provider chosen in this application's own settings; [TRANSLATE] goes to the
 * translation library. They cost different money, they answer differently, and a reply does not
 * say which one produced it — so [WriterToolRunner.run] is the single place that maps a tool to an
 * engine, which means there is exactly one line in this application where they could be crossed
 * and exactly one line to assert on.
 *
 * [SUMMARY] is "Resume" elsewhere in this fleet — the owner's name for SUMMARISE, condense this
 * text. Not a curriculum vitae, and not resuming anything that was paused. It is spelled Summary
 * on this screen and summarise on the wire so neither can be misread.
 *
 * [GRAMMAR] is not a fourth engine: it is the rewrite engine asked for the one `grammar` style,
 * which is what `ITextTools.enhance(text, "grammar")` describes.
 *
 * [usesModel] IS TRUE FOR ALL FOUR. It was once false for [TRANSLATE], because Translate went to
 * the serving application's translation library and a library takes no model — so a model picker
 * for it would have been a control that changed nothing. Translate now runs on the chat provider
 * like the other three, against a prompt that forbids every improvement the rewrite prompt
 * invites (see [WriterRegistry.translatePrompt]), which is what the owner asked for: "the option
 * to select the model that would do only translation". The flag and the route changed in the same
 * commit, and they have to: either one alone is the defect the old comment was warning about.
 *
 * [id] is the string the per-tool model preference is keyed by, so it is written down here once
 * and is not `name.lowercase()`: renaming an enum constant must not silently re-point every
 * preference the owner has set.
