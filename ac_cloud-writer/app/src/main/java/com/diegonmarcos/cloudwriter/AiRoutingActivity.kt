/**
 * PAGE 4 — "Enrutamiento de modelos de IA" / AI Model Routing.
 *
 * The same rows as cloud-keyboard's `AiRoutingScreen`, in the same order, over cloud-writer's own
 * copy of the registry and cloud-writer's own preference file.
 *
 *   1  Proveedor                 list        writer_ai.providers       default openrouter
 *   2  Instrucciones compartidas read-only   the two preambles, GENERATED from the registry
 *   3  Clave de API              READ-ONLY   see DIVERGENCE below
 *   4  Modelo                    list        the chosen provider's models, sorted by size
 *   5  Precios                   table       one line per model, eight columns, scrolls sideways
 *
 * THE ACCUMULATED FIXES THIS TABLE CARRIES, because every one of them was paid for once already:
 *
 *   214  ONE LINE PER MODEL. Eight columns do not fit a phone and the answer is to scroll, not to
 *        fold. Every cell is single-line without exception — one cell wrapping is enough to take a
 *        model onto a second line, which is the layout 214 was raised about. The scroller wraps
 *        the whole table, so the columns cannot drift out from under their headings.
 *   217  THE PRICE COLUMN IS NOT SCALED. The registry holds US dollars per million tokens, which
 *        is the unit the provider publishes, and [usdPerMillion] prints that number unchanged.
 *        There is no multiplication anywhere between the JSON and the cell. 217 was cents rendered
 *        as whole euros — a hundredfold error — and it happened because a unit was converted on
 *        the way to the screen.
 *   219  THE DATE IS ON THE PAGE. cloud-writer declares no INTERNET permission and fetches no
 *        catalogue, so every price here is a baked one; the note under the table names the day
 *        they were taken and the provider they came from. 219 was a baked 0.966 against a live
 *        0.280 with nothing on screen admitting the number had an age.
 *   247  NOTHING ON THIS PAGE CAN VETO A BUILD. The price check that talks to the third party is a
 *        reporting tester, not a gate; this application makes no catalogue request at all, so
 *        openrouter.ai being slow, moved or down cannot keep the owner's APK from shipping.
 *   186/187  Number format is fixed to three decimals and a dot regardless of locale, the size,
 *        quantisation and trained-for columns are present, short names are used in both the picker
 *        and the table, the exact model code is its own last column because it is the string you
 *        copy when something needs the literal identifier, per-model notes have a column, and the
 *        sort is by size then precision then name — presentation only; a run resolves the stored
 *        model id, never a row position.
 *
 * DIVERGENCE — ROW 3. The keyboard's API key row is an editable field. cloud-writer holds no
 * credential and has no preference slot for one; its own tester fails the build if a token-shaped
 * key ever appears in [WriterPrefs], and the manifest publishes no service precisely so the key
 * never needs to be here. So this row is READ-ONLY and says where the key actually lives. Dropping
 * the row instead would leave the owner hunting for a setting that is simply somewhere else.
