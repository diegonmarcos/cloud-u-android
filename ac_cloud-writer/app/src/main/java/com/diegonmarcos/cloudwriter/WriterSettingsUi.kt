/**
 * The shape of a cloud-writer configuration page, and the rows it is built from.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS A COPY OF. cloud-keyboard draws its settings with Compose — `SearchSettingsScreen`
 * over `ListPreference`, `SwitchPreference`, `TextInputPreference`, `PreferenceCategory`. This file
 * is the same four widgets and the same page shape, in cloud-writer's own Material 3 components
 * over cloud-writer's own store. A row is a title, an optional explanation under it, and the
 * current value; tapping a list row opens a single-choice dialog, exactly as the keyboard's does.
 *
 * WHY NOT LITERALLY THE KEYBOARD'S COMPOSABLES. Two reasons and neither is taste. The first is the
 * task: importing them is the LINK that made task 209 — one screen over the other application's
 * store, nothing editable. The second is that they are not importable in any case; every one of
 * them resolves `helium314.keyboard.latin.R`, reads `SettingsActivity.settingsContainer` and writes
 * the keyboard's own device-protected preference file. Taking the widgets would have taken the
 * store with them.
 *
 * NOTHING IN THIS FILE, OR IN ANY PAGE BUILT ON IT, READS OR WRITES ANYTHING OUTSIDE THIS
 * APPLICATION. Every value goes through [WriterPrefs], which is one private SharedPreferences file
 * in cloud-writer's own data directory. There is no `createPackageContext`, no ContentProvider, no
 * `sharedUserId` and no Intent into the keyboard's settings anywhere in this application — that is
 * asserted by test-cloud-writer-settings-pages.sh, which is what makes "same" mean "same and mine".
 *
 * ── WHAT THE UI ENHANCEMENT CHANGED HERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * These rows used to be TextViews inside LinearLayouts, built by addView against four hex literals
 * copy-pasted from MainActivity and a `PAD = 36` used as a RAW PIXEL count — so every margin on
 * every page was a different physical size on every phone, and roughly half the intended one on a
 * modern high-density Samsung. They are now Material 3 over the type scale and the colour roles,
 * in dp. No row's BEHAVIOUR moved: a list row still opens a single-choice dialog, a switch row is
 * still a whole-row target, and the preview row is still handed text composed by the same call the
 * run makes.

     * during composition is what makes it recompose when the setting changes. The one page that
     * needed it — AI Model Routing, whose model list and price table belong to the provider — gets
