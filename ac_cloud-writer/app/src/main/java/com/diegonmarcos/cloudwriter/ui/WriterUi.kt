/**
 * The rows and containers every cloud-writer screen is built from.
 *
 * ONE SET OF COMPONENTS FOR ALL FIVE SCREENS, which is the actual substance of this change. What
 * these replace is not "an old-looking style": it is the ABSENCE of a component set. Each screen
 * used to build its own TextViews inline, and the two files that did the most of it each declared
 * their own private copies of the same four hex colours and their own heading()/caption() helpers
 * with different sizes. Two copies of a style are two styles, and they had already diverged — the
 * main screen's caption was 13sp and the settings pages' was 12sp, for the same kind of sentence.
 *
 * SIZING IS DP AND sp THROUGHOUT, WHICH IT WAS NOT. The old screens called setPadding(36, ...) with
 * a raw pixel constant, so every margin in the application was 36 PHYSICAL PIXELS: about 18dp on a
 * 2x phone and 9dp on a 4x one. The spacing was therefore a different size on every device and
 * roughly half what was intended on a modern Samsung. Compose has no unit-less path — 16.dp is
 * 16dp everywhere — so this class of bug cannot recur here.
