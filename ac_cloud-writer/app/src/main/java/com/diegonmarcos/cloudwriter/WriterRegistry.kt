/**
 * cloud-writer's OWN text-tool registry: providers, model lists, Enhance prompts, Grammar prompt,
 * Resume prompts and output languages.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS A COPY OF, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT. The serving application's `AiRouter`
 * does two separable jobs: it reads a baked registry and resolves the user's choices out of it,
 * and it makes the HTTPS request. This object is a copy of the FIRST job only, over cloud-writer's
 * own `build.json::writer_ai`. The second job — the POST, the authorisation header, the timeout,
 * the chunking, the summary budget, the bullet enforcement and the provider API KEY — is not
 * copied and must never be: it stays in the serving application's process behind `ITextTools`, in
 * one copy, so a fix to it is made once. See [WriterPrefs] for the settings side.
 *
 * WHY A COPY AT ALL. The owner asked for one application that owns Text Enhance, Translate,
 * Grammar Check and Summary and that owns the model choice for each of them separately. A single
 * shared registry cannot give an application settings of its own no matter how the screens are
 * arranged: two screens over one store still edit each other, which is what task 209 — "WHY I
 * CANT EDIT NOTHING" — was actually about. The prompts and model lists here started identical to
 * cloud-mail's and the keyboard's and are free to diverge from this point on. That divergence is
 * the feature.
 *
 * Reads `BuildConfig.WRITER_AI_ROUTING_B64`, baked by app/build.gradle. Base64 because the prompts
 * carry quotes and newlines a plain BuildConfig string would not survive.
