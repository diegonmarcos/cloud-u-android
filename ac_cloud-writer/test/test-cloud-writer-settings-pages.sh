# ║ Cloud Writer has the keyboard's four configuration pages, and OWNS   ║

#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Three times now, "give app B the same pages as app A" has
# been built by pointing app B at app A's screens and app A's storage. The owner
# on the third time: "all those I SAID COPY FROM CLOUD KEYBOARD!!! I NEVER SAID
# LINK WITH IT!!! WHY I CANT EDIT NOTHING?" A page that opens and is wired to the
# other application's store ALSO EXISTS, ALSO LOOKS RIGHT, and passes any test
# that only asks whether the page is there. So no assertion below is satisfied by
# a page existing.
#
#   P1  the four pages exist AS ACTIVITIES OF THIS APPLICATION, are declared in
#       this manifest, are not exported, and are reachable from the main screen.
#   P2  INDEPENDENCE, WHICH IS THE ONE THAT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT 209. Nothing in
#       this application names the keyboard's package, classes or resources;
#       nothing opens another application's Context or preferences; and every
#       value goes through ONE private SharedPreferences file belonging to this
#       application. The reverse direction too: no sharedUserId and no
#       ContentProvider, so the keyboard has no route in either.
#   P3  every row reads AND writes through WriterPrefs, and every preference key
#       a page uses is DECLARED in WriterPrefs — a page writing a raw key would
#       be a value no other screen here can find.
#   P4  the prompt preview is GENERATED from the settings, by the same call a run
#       makes, and re-read when a setting changes. A preview that is a literal
#       matching today is the defect, not the feature.
#   P5  "Pruébalo" actually runs — through WriterToolRunner, the same object the
#       main screen's button uses.
#   P6  the LanguageTool URL is the MESH one, character for character.
#   P7  the price table carries its accumulated fixes: one line per model (214),
#       no scaling of the price (217), the as-of date on the page (219), and no
#       catalogue request that could ever veto a build (247), three decimals and
#       a fixed locale (186/187).
#   P8  THE OWNER'S OWN SCREEN, CHARACTER FOR CHARACTER. The Spanish he pasted
#       from his phone is written out below and must appear in values-es exactly.
#       This is the "his eyes, not your judgement" check.
#   P9  the defaults are the ones reported, so the page a new install shows is
#       the page that was described.
#  P10  every string resource is one aapt will accept. This container has no
#       Android SDK; a bare apostrophe XML-parses cleanly here and fails the
#       resource merge on CI, which is exactly how run 34590327712 spent forty
#       minutes to publish nothing.
#
# READS NOTHING OUTSIDE ac_cloud-writer. That is deliberate and it is the point:
# under the foreign-source rule a tester that reaches into another application's
# tree has its failure DOWNGRADED to a warning and the APK ships anyway. The
# sibling test-cloud-writer-tools.sh is mixed for good reasons of its own and
# therefore cannot be relied on to fail this build. This one can.
#
# No ripgrep. grep, awk, sed and python3 only — and a missing file is FATAL
# rather than an empty read that every assertion below would agree with.
