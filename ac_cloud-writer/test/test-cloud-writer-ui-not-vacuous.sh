# AN ASSERTION NOBODY HAS WATCHED FAIL IS DECORATION. This repository has shipped
# the proof repeatedly: an assertion comparing an expression to itself, a
# pipeline's status read through `tail`, `case $OUT in *"[NEW]"*)` where the
# brackets made a one-character class, four testers that passed only because
# ripgrep was absent, a grep that matched the commented-out line it was written
# to detect as missing, and a guard satisfied by its own KDoc prose.
#
# THE LAST ONE IS THE LIVE RISK FOR THE SIBLING. Its header paragraph NAMES
# Color.parseColor and setPadding while explaining why they are forbidden, so if
# its comment stripper ever broke, T2 and T3 would be satisfied by their own
# documentation and would go green over a fully reverted UI. Break 2 and break 3
# below are exactly that scenario, planted in the source rather than in the prose.
#
# So this runs the sibling against a DELIBERATELY BROKEN COPY, once per planted
# defect, and requires the matching assertion to NAME it.
#
# THE BREAKS ARE APPLIED TO A COPY IN A TEMPORARY DIRECTORY, never the working
# tree. A harness that edits the repository and restores afterwards is one failed
# restore away from committing its own sabotage.
