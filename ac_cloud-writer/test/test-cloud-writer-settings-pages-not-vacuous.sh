# AN ASSERTION NOBODY HAS WATCHED FAIL IS DECORATION. This repository has shipped
# the proof repeatedly: an assertion comparing an expression to itself, a
# pipeline's status read through `tail`, `case $OUT in *"[NEW]"*)` where the
# brackets made a one-character class, markers written relative to the wrong
# directory, four testers that passed only because ripgrep was absent, a grep
# that matched the commented-out line it was written to detect as missing, and a
# guard satisfied by its own KDoc. Every one printed green over a defect. The
# sibling tester itself shipped one on its very first run: its comment stripper
# ate the `//` of `https://` and then reported the URL as missing.
#
# So this runs the sibling against a DELIBERATELY BROKEN COPY, once per planted
# defect, and requires the matching assertion to NAME it. If a check goes blind,
# this goes red and says which one.
#
# EVERY BREAK BELOW IS A REAL REGRESSION SHAPE. Four of them are precisely how
# task 209 happened — a page pointed at the other application's storage, a
# settings file renamed to the shared one, a keyboard symbol imported, a page
# opened by Intent into the keyboard — because those are the ones that look
# completely fine on screen and pass any test that only asks whether a page
# exists.
#
# THE BREAKS ARE APPLIED TO A COPY IN A TEMPORARY DIRECTORY, never the working
# tree. A harness that edits the repository and restores afterwards is one failed
# restore away from committing its own sabotage.
#
# python3 plants them: an in-place edit that must match EXACTLY is one place
# where a silent no-op — the anchor moved, nothing was replaced — has to be an
# error rather than an empty diff, and that case is checked explicitly.
