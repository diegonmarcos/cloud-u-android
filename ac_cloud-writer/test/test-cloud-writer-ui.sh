# WHAT THIS FILE CAN AND CANNOT PROVE, said first so no one reads more into a
# green than is there. It proves the SOURCE still has the properties the UI work
# gave it. It does not prove the screen looks right — only a device can do that,
# and "a Material component is imported" is not "a screen rendered". Nothing
# below asserts that a composable exists, because that assertion is worthless.
#
# What it does assert is the set of things that would silently UNDO the work:
#
#   T1  the toolchain restated in build.gradle still matches build.json. The
#       plugins{} block takes literals only, so the versions cannot be
#       interpolated out of the JSON and there are deliberately two copies. A
#       mirror nothing compares is a copy, and a copy is how a bump lands in the
#       JSON and never reaches the build.
#   T2  the hand-rolled palette is gone and stays gone. Four hex literals were
#       copy-pasted into two files and had already drifted apart. A
#       Color.parseColor in this application is a colour that ignores the theme,
#       and on the owner's black Power Saving phone that is a lit grey rectangle.
#   T3  no raw-pixel spacing. Every margin in this app used to be
#       setPadding(36, ...) — 36 PHYSICAL PIXELS, so about 18dp on a 2x phone and
#       9dp on a 4x one. The spacing was a different size on every device and
#       roughly half the intended one on a modern Samsung.
#   T4  every screen is drawn INSIDE CloudWriterTheme. A setContent that forgets
#       it compiles, runs, and draws the stock purple Material palette in light
#       mode on a phone that is in dark mode — which is the single most visible
#       way this work could regress and the least likely to be noticed in a diff.
#   T5  the price table's cells are still single-line. Task 214 is one line per
#       model; restyling is exactly how a cell is let go multi-line "so it fits",
#       and the existing settings tester checks the column widths but not this.
#   T6  the four home-screen cards each have a description, in BOTH locales. The
#       cards are the point of the home-screen change and their descriptions are
#       new strings — task 221 was 44 English labels reaching a Spanish phone.
#
# FAIL CLOSED. Every check below treats a file it cannot read, a value it cannot
# parse or a tool it cannot run as a FAILURE, never as a pass. Four testers in
# this repository once passed only because ripgrep was absent and their `rg` call
# failed open; nothing here shells out to anything but python3 and grep.
#
# COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED BEFORE MATCHING. A grep that matches its own explanatory
# prose is a real defect shipped in this repository more than once — including in
# this application's sibling tester. The prose above names Color.parseColor and
# setPadding, and would satisfy T2 and T3 if the file were read raw.
