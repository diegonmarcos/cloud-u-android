#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. cloud-writer is the application the owner asked for, and it
# is the FIRST entry in TextTools.SERVICE_PACKAGES — the ordered preference
# every consumer in this fleet resolves the text tools against. That means one
# element in one manifest decides whether this application is a peer that asks
# for a rewrite or the application that owns every consumer's Enhance, Summary,
# Translate and Grammar at once. Nothing warns about crossing that line: the
# takeover is silent, instant, and total.
#
# Every assertion below guards a way this application can be silently turned
# into something worse than itself.
#
#   W1  IT DOES NOT PUBLISH THE ITextTools ACTION. The moment it does, every
#       consumer rebinds here at its next rebind. This build cannot honour that
#       — the owner's provider key lives in cloud-keyboard's sandbox and no
#       install moves it — so serving would answer "No API key" to four tools
#       that work today, having first taken them from the peer that could still
#       do them. Read as XML, never grepped: this application's own manifest
#       comment NAMES that action several times explaining why it is absent, so
#       a text search would match its own reasoning and report a hijack.
#   W2  each tool reaches the engine it claims, and the three that use a model
#       resolve THEIR OWN. A crossed pair bills a translation to the language
#       model or sends a rewrite through a translator, and the reply does not
#       say which one answered. A per-tool model that resolved the same tool
#       three times would make the owner's whole request decorative, and no
#       screen would show it.
#   W3  no silent exit from a run. A tap that does nothing and says nothing is
#       indistinguishable from a crash, a missing permission and a dead peer.
#   W4  NO CREDENTIAL EVER LANDS HERE. This application names a provider and a
#       model; the peer spends the key. A revealAiKey call or a token-shaped
#       preference key would put a second copy of the owner's credential on the
#       device, which is the one thing the binder design exists to prevent.
#   W5  Grammar Check refuses rather than falls back. Its prompt is one named
#       registry style; falling back to the default style would send "improve
#       this text" under a button labelled Grammar Check.
#   W6  the registry is internally consistent — every provider's default_model
#       is a model that provider actually lists. A default nothing resolves is a
#       route that fails mid-run with no screen having said so.
#   W7  the application id is the one the shared address list reserves. If they
#       differ, the day this application does serve, nothing will resolve it.
#   W8  it is registered in the Constellation store's derived registry. Missing
#       there is an APK the owner cannot find from his phone.
#
# The assertions are STRUCTURAL — which call sits inside which branch — because
# that structure IS the property. A wording check would pass over a rewrite that
# puts the defect straight back.
#
# No ripgrep, deliberately: four testers in this repository once passed only
# because ripgrep was absent and their call failed open. awk, grep and python3
# only, and a missing file is FATAL rather than an empty read that every
# assertion agrees with.
