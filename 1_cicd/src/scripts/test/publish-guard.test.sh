#
# WHY THIS EXISTS.
# The guard lived on ship-cloud-superapp ALONE for four days, so 27 ship
# workflows could report success having published nothing — the failure the
# owner pays for most often, because his only signal that work reached his phone
# is a green run plus the application behaving differently. When the run is
# green and nothing changed he reports the FEATURE as broken and the next agent
# hunts a phantom bug in Kotlin (#189/#211/#244, #176, #45).
#
# This repository has also shipped four guards that could never fire: an
# assertion comparing an expression to itself, a pipeline status read through
# `tail`, `case $OUT in *"[NEW]"*)` matching one character, and four testers
# passing because ripgrep was absent. A guard nobody has watched go red is
# decoration, so this asserts BOTH polarities of the engine and the presence of
# the wiring in every generated workflow.
#
# It reads .github/workflows — the files GitHub actually runs — not the sources,
# because the whole point is that the guard is live, and a source that never
# reached the generated copy is exactly the drift 'generated files are up to
# date' exists to catch and this test must not duplicate.
