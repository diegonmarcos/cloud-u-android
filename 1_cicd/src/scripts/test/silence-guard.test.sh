# WHY THIS EXISTS. A guard that has only ever been watched succeeding is
# indistinguishable from a guard that returns 0 unconditionally. This
# repository shipped an assertion last week that compared an expression to
# itself and printed green, and another whose search window ran past the code
# it meant to check — so one case below deliberately renames the entry point
# and demands the guard notice it is now reading nothing.
#
# Every case BREAKS the repository in one specific way, demands the guard
# notice that exact way, and throws the copy away. The break happens in a
# throwaway copy of the tree, never in the working tree.
#
# No ripgrep anywhere: it was established that the CI runner does not have it,
# and testers here have passed on its absence rather than on their assertions.
