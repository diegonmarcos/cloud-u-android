#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A guard only ever watched succeeding is indistinguishable
# from `exit 0`. Ticket #463's whole premise is that the one-PDF-engine
# invariant "holds by luck" today -- it was never enforced, and the defect it
# exists to prevent (a second engine arriving silently) has therefore never
# been exercised. This file exercises it: it drops a renderer into a non-
# drive app tree nine ways and requires the guard to RED each one, then
# rebuilds the fleet clean and requires GREEN. A green verdict on a guard
# whose red path has never run is the fleet's dominant defect, found at six
# separate layers.
#
# The fixture mirrors the REAL repo shape the policy was written against: the
# two legitimately-vendored read-only renderers (Mattermost's pdfium viewer,
# Element X's mediaviewer PdfRenderer) present under the policy's EXACT
# exclusion paths, everything else clean -- which is what must be green today.
# The mutation cases then add a renderer OUTSIDE those exclusions and require
# RED. The policy data, not this file, owns the exclusion list; the fixture
# just has to reproduce it verbatim or the green case is testing a different
# world than CI runs.
#
# No ripgrep, and nothing outside coreutils + python3. Testers in this
# repository have previously passed only because a tool was missing; the
# guard is python3 and this file is bash and nothing more.
