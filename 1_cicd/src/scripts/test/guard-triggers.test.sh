# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# Three gates, each watched going red on a fixture before it is trusted green:
#   inject    refuses an unclassified guard, a double classification, a name
#             with no workflow, and a filter stacked on a hand-written paths:;
#             writes the declared paths plus the workflow's own source, and is
#             idempotent.
#   coverage  a guard that reads a file its paths do not match is a GAP; a guard
#             step that fails is a FAIL; a correct declaration is COVERED.
#   fanout    GitHub's push-filter semantics (* stops at /, ** does not, the
#             last matching pattern decides, ! excludes, tags-only never fires
#             for a branch push), on which every before/after number rests.
#
# python3 (+PyYAML), strace, coreutils; no network, no build.
