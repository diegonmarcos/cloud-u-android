# ── cicd: engine ↔ vendored build.sh parity ────────────────────────

# workflow runs THAT file — 1_cicd/src/scripts/*-engine.sh is only its source.
# Editing the engine alone changes nothing at ship time, which is exactly how
# the ABI gate and the GHCR auto-delete gate came to exist in the engine and
# not in the file GitHub executed. That drift then produced two wrong outage
# diagnoses in one day, because the code being read was not the code running.
#
# So the copy relationship is now DECLARED (build.json::vendored_engine) and
# ENFORCED here: byte-identical or the generator goes red. It is also why the
# publish gate hashes the vendored build.sh rather than the engine — a
# parity-fixing sync lands in the app tree and correctly republishes that app.

# ── cicd: derive trigger paths from the data that declares them ─────
#
# on:push:paths was hand-maintained beside build.json, so it drifted silently
# and in the worst way: a workflow watching nothing real never runs and nobody
# gets an error. Three had already drifted when a check was added here -- two
# watching their own generated copy (self-triggering on unrelated commits),
# one watching a sibling repo a path filter can never see.
#
# Checking was not enough: the check told you a module-map dir was unwatched
# and then you hand-added it, which is the drift it was meant to end. Every
# dir the module map declares is now ADDED here automatically, and dead
# entries (paths no longer in the repo, and the workflow's own generated copy,
# which self-triggers on every unrelated commit that runs this generator) are
# dropped.
#
# It UNIONS rather than replaces, deliberately. A module map is a floor, not a
# ceiling: the fork apps have no `modules` block at all and re-point
# projectDir from settings.gradle.kts, and ab_cloud-libs-shared/lib-apks
# legitimately builds EVERY shared module — an input set no map expresses. A
# derivation that replaced the block silently deleted five real triggers from
# media-center on its first run, which is the exact failure mode (a workflow
# watching nothing real never runs and reports no error) this section exists
# to prevent.
#
# The publish gate then hashes THIS list rather than a second, parallel one —
# see cloud-android-source-identity.sh. Anything that can start a build is
# therefore also something the gate weighs, so the gate can never skip a
# rebuild that a real change triggered.
