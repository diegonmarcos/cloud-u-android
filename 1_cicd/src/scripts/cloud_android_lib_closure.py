cloud_android_lib_closure — #763: which shared library directories are really
inputs of an application. ONE answer, imported by everything that asks:

  cloud-android-ship-repo-workflow-engine.sh   the ship workflow's trigger paths
  cloud-android-mesh-source-guard.py           G1 (closure reaches core+devtools)
                                               and G2 (the ship watches exactly it)
  cloud-android-lib-classes.py                 which non-GUI libs an app compiles

Before #763 the trigger paths were the build.json module map UNIONED with every
hand-written entry ever added, and a hand entry was never dropped while its
directory existed. Measured on 2026-10-02: cloud-vault watched analytics,
browser and updater and compiled none of them, cloud-mail watched analytics,
the SuperApp watched fin (it left with the MyFin dashboard). Each such entry
rebuilt the app for a change that cannot move its bytes, and — because the
publish gate hashes the same list — republished it as an update with nothing in
it.

An application's shared-lib INPUTS are the union of:
  closure   `project(':libs:X')` dependencies in the app's own gradle scripts
            and patches (patches: added lines only), expanded over the shared
            libs' own build.gradle edges — but only into modules the app
            INCLUDES (build.json::modules, settings `include`), because a lib
            edge like updater's `if (findProject(':libs:shizuku-adb-debug-tools'))`
            exists only in builds that include its target
  modules   every dir build.json::modules maps under the shared libs root (an
            included project is configured, and its manifest may merge)
  sources   a shared lib dir named by literal path in a non-comment line of
            the app's gradle/kts files, or as the path value of a non-_doc
            JSON key — the by-reference compiles (libs/sysdns'
            SystemDnsBridge in the terminals) and data reads no project edge shows

CLI  cloud_android_lib_closure.py ROOT [APP_DIR]   prints each app's inputs
