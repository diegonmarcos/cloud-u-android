# ║ cloud-android-publish-guard — a green run that shipped nothing   ║
# ║ is the worst possible outcome, so it must not be green           ║
# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# The owner's only signal that work reached his phone is a green run followed by
# the application behaving differently. When a run goes green having published
# nothing he installs, sees no change, and reports the FEATURE as broken — and
# the next agent hunts a phantom bug in Kotlin for hours. That has happened
# repeatedly: a sidebar "fixed" three times over (#189, #211, #244); a
# containers push green with Build and Deploy skipped (#176); a ship green with
# the post-hook never run (#45); a stale workspace whose CHANGED_DIRS mismatch
# deployed nothing, green.
#
# This guard existed for ONE application (ship-cloud-superapp, written after the
# 2026-09-05 update deadlock) and was never generalised, so the other 27 ship
# workflows could each report success having published nothing. It is now the
# single implementation all of them call — two copies of one idea is how #228
# and #209 happened, and it is not being repeated here.

#
#     outcome    steps.publish.outcome — what the publish step actually did
#     gate-skip  steps.gate.outputs.skip — the PUBLISH GATE's own answer to
#                "did this application's source move?". Read from the gate, not
#                re-derived: a second answer to that question would drift from
#                the first, and the first is what decided whether to build.
#     selected   the publish step's own `if:` expression, rendered by GitHub to
#                true/false. The workflow generator writes it here verbatim from
#                that step, so there is exactly one copy of it in the file.
#     event      github.event_name
#
# WHY `selected` IS DATA HERE AND NOT A CONDITION ON THIS STEP.
# The obvious generalisation — put the publish step's `if:` on the guard too —
# is wrong, and wrong in the way that matters: the guard then cannot run in
# precisely the case it was written for, a publish step SKIPPED BY ITS OWN
# CONDITION. It would be a guard that is structurally unable to fire on its
# motivating bug, which is the fourth entry in this repository's list of guards
# that could never fire. So the step runs on everything but a cancellation, and
# the condition arrives as a fact to judge rather than as permission to look.
#
# WHAT IS NOT A FAILURE, AND WHY EACH ONE MATTERS
#   * THE PUBLISH GATE SKIPPED THIS APPLICATION because its own source did not
#     change. That is the gate working. A guard that reddened every unrelated
#     push would be turned off within a day.
#   * A MATRIX LEG THAT NEVER FEEDS THE RELEASE, e.g. ship-cloud-ide's x86_64
#     leg, which distributes through GHCR `latest-x86_64` and would fail
#     gh-release outright because no unsuffixed apk is in dist/. Deselected on a
#     push and correct — reported, not failed.
#   * CANCELLED. `cancel-in-progress` is on every ship workflow and agents push
#     concurrently, so cancellations are routine and are neither a pass nor a
#     fail.
#   * A FOREIGN TESTER DOWNGRADE. Verified, not inherited: a downgraded tester
#     leaves cloud-android-test-engine.sh exiting 0, the publish step's `if:` is
#     satisfied and the publish RUNS. Downgrading is precisely what lets the
#     publish happen, so "published nothing because a foreign gate was
#     downgraded" is unreachable and this guard cannot fire on it.
#
# WHAT IS A FAILURE
#   * selected, and the publish did not succeed. The gate said these bytes are
#     new and nothing carries them.
#   * DESELECTED BY A workflow_dispatch INPUT. This is the 2026-09-05 deadlock
#     itself: a dispatch with create_release=false built an APK, uploaded it as
#     a workflow artifact nobody installs, cancelled the push run that would
#     have published, and exited green. Deliberate or not, the run shipped
#     nothing while the source had moved, and it must say so in the only
#     language a pipeline has.
#
# FAILS CLOSED. An empty outcome means no step in this job carries `id: publish`
# (or it was misspelt) and the guard is asserting about a step that does not
# exist; an unrenderable `selected` means the same about the condition. Both
# refuse rather than pass.
