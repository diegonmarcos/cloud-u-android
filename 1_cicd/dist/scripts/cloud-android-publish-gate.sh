# ║ cloud-android-publish-gate — publish only when the source moved  ║
# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# Runs as the first step of every ship job, right after checkout, and answers
# one question: has anything that can change this APK changed since the bytes
# currently on the release were published?
#
#   check <app-dir> [variant-id]
#       sets step output skip=true|false (plus identity/asset/tag).
#       skip=true  → the whole rest of the job is if:'d out. The run is GREEN,
#                    takes ~30s instead of ~30min, and the release asset's
#                    updated_at does not move — so no phone sees an update.
#   stamp <app-dir> [variant-id]
#       last step of a job that DID publish: uploads <asset>.source carrying
#       the identity those bytes were built from.
#
# ONE JOB, MANY ASSETS: --asset NAME --paths-from FILE
#   ship-cloud-libs builds every module under ab_cloud-libs-shared/libs/ as its
#   own APK, so there is no single asset for build.json to name and the
#   resolution below yields nothing - which made this gate fail open and
#   republish all 24 on any touch to any shared module. With both options the
#   caller gates each asset on its own inputs, so a change to libs/updater
#   republishes the updater APK and the one library that depends on it rather
#   than the whole set. --asset without --paths-from is refused: it would gate
#   one asset against the whole app'"'"'s identity, which is the bug, not the fix.
#
# The identity lives as a small sidecar asset beside the APK, in the same
# place and with the same lifetime as the .sha256 sidecar. It is not derived
# from the APK, so a non-reproducible rebuild cannot perturb it, and it is
# not kept in a separate store that could drift away from the asset it
# describes.
#
# WHEN THE GATE DOES NOT APPLY (fail-open, always publish):
#   * a tag push — cutting a tag is an explicit intent to publish
#   * PUBLISH_GATE_FORCE=1
#   * the release/sidecar/sha256 is missing or unreadable — an incomplete
#     publish must be repaired, never skipped
#   * build.json declares no gh_release asset name
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated via GH_TOKEN), jq, git.
