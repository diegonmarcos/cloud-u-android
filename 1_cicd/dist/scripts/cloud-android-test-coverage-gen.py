# 24 of the 28 ship workflows executed no test of any kind, so for 24
# applications the pipeline's only question was "did Gradle exit 0" — and an
# application with zero testers produced the same green tick as one with fifty
# passing ones. A gap nobody can see is a gap nobody schedules.
#
# DERIVED, not written down. A hand-maintained inventory is a list that is true
# on the day it is written and silently wrong a week later — this repository has
# had three of those (a workflow watching nothing real, a dist artefact with no
# source, a tester counting participants). Everything countable is counted from
# the tree here; the only authored half is the one that cannot be derived,
# "what would the cheapest meaningful first test be", which lives in
# 1_cicd/src/data/test-coverage.json.
#
# REFUSES if an application has no note, or a note names something that is no
# longer here — so adding a ship workflow forces an answer about its coverage,
# and deleting one cannot leave a stale entry behind.
#
# A FILE OF ITS OWN, not a heredoc inside the workflow engine, because the
# inputs it counts are the WHOLE TREE: adding one shell tester under any app
# changes this artefact, and its author has no reason to be thinking about
# 1_cicd at all. Three commits in one day landed a tester, left this file
# stale, and turned main red on `generated files are up to date`. The advice
# that gate used to print — run ./build.sh workflow — purges and rebuilds
# 1_cicd/dist wholesale and races every other agent working in the tree (it
# emptied 55 files under 1_cicd/dist/cicd on 2026-09-30). So the narrow path
# has to EXIST before the gate can name it, and this is that path: one
# derivation, two callers (the engine, and ./build.sh test-coverage).
#
# REFUSES TO COLLAPSE. It writes nothing when it counted no applications at
# all, because a deriver whose inputs moved or vanished otherwise emits a
# valid-looking empty artefact and the emptiness reads as a fact about the
# repository. cloud-infra's pre-commit hook did exactly that and took 78
# services to 0 in one commit.
