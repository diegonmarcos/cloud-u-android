# ║ cloud-android-one-pdf-engine-guard — the fleet keeps ONE PDF     ║
# ║ engine, reached by manifest, never copied in                     ║
# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Ticket #463 was filed as "pdf.js is copied per-app in
# cloud-drive AND cloud-mail -- extract a shared lib" and measured on
# origin/main THAT WAS FALSE: cloud-mail ships zero pdf assets and zero
# viewer, and its only PDF code hands the attachment OUT via an ACTION_VIEW
# chooser, which #458 already wired to the PDF reader declared in ac_cloud-
# drive's manifest. So the fleet ALREADY has exactly one PDF engine reached
# by manifest -- and nothing enforces that. The invariant holds by luck.
#
# This guard makes a second engine impossible to arrive silently. It fails
# when an in-process PDF renderer appears in any app tree other than
# ac_cloud-drive, and its failure MESSAGE TEACHES THE RULE (a guard that only
# says "unexpected file" gets deleted by the next person who hits it).
# Extracting pdf.js into ab_cloud-libs-shared is deliberately NOT built: an
# abstraction with one consumer is cost with no payer, and this fleet has had
# to unwind speculative structure before.
#
# Everything it knows comes from 1_cicd/src/data/one-pdf-engine-guard.json.
# No app, no path and no renderer name appears below. Adding a renderer
# filename, a code marker, or a legitimate exclusion is a DATA edit.
#
# No ripgrep: it is not on the CI runner, and testers here have previously
# passed on its absence rather than on their assertions.
