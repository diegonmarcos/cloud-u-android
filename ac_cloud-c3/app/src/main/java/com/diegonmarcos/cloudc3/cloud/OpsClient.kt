/**
 * The acting half of the container sheet — c3-infra-api's operations routes.
 *
 * The API already draws the line this UI needs. It exposes a container and its
 * service as SEPARATE things:
 *
 *   POST /vms/{vm}/containers/{name}/{start|stop|restart|update}
 *   POST /vms/{vm}/services/{service}/{start|stop}
 *
 * which is exactly the Container / App split the sheet renders. So the two
 * columns are not a presentation choice layered on top of one endpoint — they
 * are the two things the infrastructure actually distinguishes: the container
 * is the box, the service is what systemd runs inside it.
 *
 * EVERY CALL IS AUTHENTICATED. These routes sit behind Caddy's forward_auth on
 * api.diegonmarcos.com/c3-infra-api, so an Authelia bearer is mandatory. The
 * token is the one libs:ops already keeps for Dagu ([com.diegonmarcos.superapp
 * .ops.dagu.DaguPrefs]) — reused rather than re-collected, because a second
 * place to paste the same token is a second place for it to go stale.
 *
 * Failures are NAMED. "Action failed" on a stop button is indistinguishable
 * from a container that ignored the request, and this screen can stop things
 * people depend on.
 *
 * Diagnose with:  adb logcat -s C3Ops
