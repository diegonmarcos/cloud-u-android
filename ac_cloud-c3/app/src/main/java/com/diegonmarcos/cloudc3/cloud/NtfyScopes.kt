/**
 * USER vs INFRA classification for ntfy channels.
 *
 * The registry is one flat list of snake_case topics, so a notification about
 * this phone and one about a container restarting arrived indistinguishable in
 * a single alphabetical list. A channel's scope is decided by its PREFIX, and
 * the prefix→scope map is declared in build.json::ui.ntfy rather than written
 * here (FIRE RULE #6): adding `me_` or a new `sec_`-style family is a data
 * edit, not a code change.
 *
 * Unmatched prefixes fall to the LAST declared scope instead of being dropped.
 * A channel appearing in the wrong bucket is visible and fixable; one filtered
 * out of both is invisible, and invisible is how a channel stops being watched.
