/**
 * The app-specific half of a container's Infos tab.
 *
 * A container's generic facts — VM, DNS, port, exposure — are the same shape
 * for all 102 of them. What actually matters about a container is the thing it
 * is FOR, and that differs per app: Caddy is its routing table, WireGuard is
 * its mesh, Authelia is which routes it guards. Showing only the generic fields
 * describes the box and says nothing about the job.
 *
 * Every block here is DECLARATIVE and already on the device — the same
 * data/services_*.json and data/mesh.json the dashboard is built from. Nothing
 * is fetched, so the tab stays instant and works with the mesh down, which is
 * exactly when you want to read the config.
 *
 * This is a deliberate `when` over container names rather than a data-driven
 * table: what to show for Caddy is genuine per-app knowledge, not a parameter,
 * and pretending otherwise would mean inventing a schema that describes only
 * the cases already written. An unknown container simply gets no extra block.
