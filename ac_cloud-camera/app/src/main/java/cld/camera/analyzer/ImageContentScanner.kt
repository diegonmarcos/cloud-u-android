/*
 * Task #461 — the camera's entry point onto the ONE shared image-scan engine.
 *
 * A camera's natural "scan" is the thing it just captured: the user holds the
 * phone up to a code or a page, so a scan meant for content must read the
 * photograph, not only decode the live preview. This class runs the shared
 * engine (libs:ml-l-image — ImageScanEngine: ZXing barcode decode + ML
 * Kit OCR) over a captured image's content Uri, off whatever thread the
 * caller chooses. It is deliberately a thin shell: the engine, the typed
 * payload parser and the failure vocabulary all live in the one shared
 * module that cloud-drive and cloud-media-center already compile in — a
 * private copy of the decode path is the exact defect #170/#261 this fleet
 * fixed, so there is none here.
 *
 * Both halves are always asked, exactly as the shared engine's callers do:
 * decodeBarcode returns null for "no barcode" AND for "could not load", and
 * the OCR result's error string is the tiebreaker that tells them apart.
 *
 * #772 identify: the same engine also RECOGNISES the photo (labels with
 * probabilities, objects) on the route the user picked in More settings ▸
 * Image recognition route — on-device ML Kit by default, an OpenRouter
 * decision model only when picked (the engine falls back to on-device on
 * error, timeout or no token). Barcode and OCR stay on their contract-1 calls,
 * so they keep working against an engine too old to recognise.
 *
 * #798 live identification (IdentifyActivity) also comes through this door: detect asks the engine
 * for objects with a full-label classifier and tracking ids, labels, or text lines, always on
 * device; a saved snapshot is then identified on the user's route through recognize.
