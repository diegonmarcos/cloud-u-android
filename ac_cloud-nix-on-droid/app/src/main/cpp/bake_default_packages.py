"""#595 -- bakes agent tooling (git, node, claude) into the nix-on-droid store
this terminal ships, so a fresh install never has to run upstream's
interactive, networked first-login wizard just to get a shell with a package
in it.

Runs AFTER patch_bootstrap_ids.py, on the already id-rewritten zip. Requires
`nix` (flakes + nix-command experimental features) on PATH and network
access to realize the declared attrs -- CI-time only, never on the phone.

This bootstrap format is TermuxInstaller-derived (see that class's extraction
loop): a plain zip entry carries no permission bits at all -- ZipInputStream
ignores them -- so two manifest entries do the real work instead:
  SYMLINKS.txt     "<target>←<link-path-relative-to-root>" per line
  EXECUTABLES.txt  one link-path-relative-to-root per line, chmod 0700 each
Regular files therefore need no special handling; every symlink and every
executable this script adds MUST go through one of those two manifests, or
the installed app will silently ship a plain-file copy of a symlink, or a
binary nothing ever chmods +x.

Usage:
    bake_default_packages.py <input.zip> <output.zip> <nixpkgs_pin> \
        <comma-separated attrs> <profile_link> <fallback_init_script> <app_id> \
        <nix_system, e.g. aarch64-linux> <shared_root_name> <login_shell_attr> \
        <dns resolv_conf> <dns nameservers csv> <extras expr> <extras attrs csv> <preload>

#612 also patches bin/login here (not a separate script): it is the same
"add text to a generated file" job as the login-inner patch above, on a zip
this function already has open.
