# Obsidian plugin mapping (Cloud Notes vault view)

Obsidian plugin to Cloud Notes feature. status: builtin = delivered in the app now, planned = on the roadmap (the plugin is listed as not yet supported), na = not applicable (hosted service, desktop-only, or owned by another fleet app). The default set is the union of the core and community plugins enabled in cloud-me-pvt-notes and git-repos-master; test/test-vault.sh fails when a plugin enabled in either vault is missing here.
