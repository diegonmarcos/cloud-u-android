# ac_cloud-notes tester (#513): the WebView must be able to BOOT.
#
# The white page Diego shipped was not a crash, a missing bundle or a missing
# .so — the APK carried all 114 JS chunks and a 51 MB libaffine_mobile_native.so.
# It was ONE line of TypeScript: ExternalFileOpener, which App() renders on the
# ROOT framework provider, called `useService(ImportService)`, and ImportService
# is registered `framework.scope(WorkspaceScope).service(ImportService, …)`. The
# resolver walks the provider stack and, finding no workspace scope on it,
# executes `throw new ComponentNotFoundError(identifier)` — during the FIRST
# render, with no error boundary anywhere above it. React unmounted the whole
# tree; the WebView painted white; the FAB's window listener was never installed,
# so the button "triggered nothing". One fault, every symptom.
#
# Nothing in the pipeline could see it. TypeScript cannot: the call type-checks.
# Gradle cannot: it builds an APK around a bundle it never runs. The ship run
# went green and published a blank app.
#
# So this tester reads the invariant that was violated, off the source, with no
# build and no device:
#
#   A service resolved on the ROOT provider — useService(X), useServices({X}),
#   frameworkProvider.get(X) inside the android entrypoint — must NOT be one
#   that some module registers under a `.scope(...)`.
#
# The scoped set is DERIVED from the modules on every run (never a list kept
# here, which would rot the first time upstream moves a service between scopes).
# Paths come from build.json::tests.root_scope.
