/**
 * JS bridge exposed to news.html as `window.NewsBridge`.
 *
 * SECURITY: this bridge is only safe to attach because the WebView it
 * is registered on loads a LOCAL asset we control
 * (file:///android_asset/news.html) — see MainActivity. Never attach a
 * JavascriptInterface bridge to a WebView that can navigate to
 * remote/attacker-controlled content: any page loaded there would gain
 * the same Java-callable surface as our own UI. (Same note as CalBridge
 * in ac_cloud-agenda.)
 *
 * Every method returns a JSON STRING (never a raw object) and every
 * epoch-millis value crosses the bridge as a STRING, same convention
 * as CalBridge: JS numbers on this bridge are doubles and would lose
 * precision on a 64-bit millis value. Network work (refresh) runs on
 * a background executor with @Volatile status fields the WebView polls
 * — this bridge must never block the WebView's JS thread on I/O.

     *  not-yet-discovered source is never left with nothing to pick).
     *  Three populating strategies, per [NewsChannelConfig]'s kdoc:
     *   - query-driven (gdelt-self, google-news): a synthetic
     *     [ALL_CHANNEL_ID] "All" channel FIRST (see that const's kdoc —
     *     this is the merged feed, [articles]' whole reason for
     *     existing), followed by one channel per entry in the LIVE
     *     topics store (baked + custom, in effective order) — NOT the
     *     baked topics.json list alone — so adding/removing a topic in
     *     the Topics tab is reflected immediately, with zero
     *     duplication of the topic list into data/sources.json. Each
     *     non-synthetic channel's id IS the topic id. Being first makes
     *     "All" the fallback in [activeChannelId] — i.e. the default —
     *     for any source that hasn't had a channel explicitly picked
     *     yet, matching the pre-two-row-nav default of landing on "All".
     *   - dynamic-channel (ntfy-self): the last successfully-discovered
     *     list from [DynamicChannelStore] (refreshed by NewsSync's
     *     syncRssDynamic on every [refresh]).
     *   - fixed rss (bbc-world, guardian-world, ...): [source]'s own
     *     declared `channels`, already guaranteed non-empty by
     *     [NewsSourcesConfig.parseSources].
     *  Deliberately NO synthetic "All" for the dynamic-channel/fixed
     *  cases: those channels are genuinely different feeds (BBC's World
     *  vs Business section, ntfy-self's independent topics), not facets
     *  of one query set — merging them isn't what the old "All" meant,

     *  - MEDIA: exactly ONE of the 8 YouTube channels, chosen by plain

     *    takes an explicit channel id per call and is otherwise
     *    stateless, so unlike a fixed rss source there is no persisted
     *    "active channel" selection to fetch instead; round-robin still
     *    guarantees every channel is refreshed at least once every 8
     *    calls rather than picking one arbitrarily forever.

     *    window (data/events.json) has elapsed since its last sync —

     *    fetched per call, not 20 — the only call that touches all of
     *    them is the very first one after install, when every enabled
     *    calendar is legitimately due (cold cache).
     * All three failures are isolated from each other (same as within
