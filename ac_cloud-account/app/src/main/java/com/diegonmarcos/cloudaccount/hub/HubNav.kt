/**
 * The five sections (build.json::ui, #1081): Personal Info (Me, Wallet, Autocomplete), Configs (Android, Desktop, C3;
 * public, no secrets), Data (Secrets, Backups, Devices; private), Connect (Status, Authentication providers) and
 * Activity. One place per thing. A page inside a strip ("sites" under "autocomplete") is addressed by its own id;
 * NavSection.page resolves it at any depth.
 *
 * Pages in libs:account still open each other with the ids of the old islands (`open("setup", "perms")`,
 * `go("setup", "adb-shell")`, `open("account", "connect")`), and three earlier layouts (the five islands, the four of
 * 2026-10-13 and the four of 2026-10-14) had ids of their own; [resolve] maps every old (section, page) to where that
 * page lives now, so no link, OPEN intent or bookmark breaks and no lib file changes.
