# test-account-hub: Cloud Account's information architecture (a0_docs/eng-specs/cloud-account-ia.md), statically.
#
# Holds that:
#  1. build.json::ui.bottom_nav is personal, configs, data, connect, activity (#1081), default personal; the
#     strips (Autocomplete, Android, Secrets, Backups, Devices, Status, Authentication providers) are declared as
#     a page's own pages, every section declares its background, and MainActivity draws a second PageTabs for them
#     through NavDecl.stripSurface;
#  2. every old (section, page) id - the five islands, the four of 2026-10-13 and of 2026-10-14 - has its place in
#     HubNav.LEGACY, every LEGACY target is a declared leaf, and MainActivity's go() and OPEN-intent deep links
#     resolve through it;
#  3. the hub pages draw a secret value only through RevealGate (a reveal / copy asks device auth first), the
#     copy goes through SecretClipboard (auto-clear), MainActivity provides the device auth;
#  4. no hub file logs, and none reads the AI key (the decisions-use guard's key_readers ratchet);
#  5. one place per thing: Home > Connections is tiles, the Connections table, Setup all; Home > Import is the
#     personal-data importer then the token importer; the token list (SecretLine) is drawn by the provider card
#     only; each provider card and each app profile has its own Setup; the Apps page has a loading and an
#     error state; the Connections view and each provider card lead with the status pill and the next action and
#     open their details on a tap (a list, never a wide grid).
# Then each mutation is planted in a scratch copy and the check must go RED. The behaviour itself is
# HubTest.kt's (Robolectric).
