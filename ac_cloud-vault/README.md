# Cloud Vault

Standalone Android password-manager client. Two build paths live in this
app. **The shipping app (since 2026-08-18) is the rebranded source fork of
Bitwarden's Android app** — CI's push-triggered job builds it and publishes
it as `Cloud-Vault.apk` (GHCR `:latest` + the GH release rolling tag), which
is the URL the superapp's constellation store points at. `build.sh`'s
default commands (`build`/`release`/`ship`/...) still produce the legacy
in-tree WebView wrapper around `vault.diegonmarcos.com` (self-hosted
Vaultwarden), now a manual-only CI fallback (`build_webview=true` on
workflow dispatch).

## Autofill (tier 1 of 3)

Cloud Vault is the phone's autofill service and (Android 14+) its passkeys & passwords
provider; Cloud Browser and the keyboard are tiers 2 and 3. What each tier may fill, and the
rules between them (secrets only through the framework, the browser never fills secret
fields, the keyboard hides its strip on password fields), are in
[`docs/autofill-tiers-contract.md`](docs/autofill-tiers-contract.md). Cloud Vault's own rules
live in `app/src/main/kotlin/com/x8bit/bitwarden/data/autofill/cloud/`; the ship workflow runs
the autofill JVM suites before it publishes.

## Fork: vault (Bitwarden Android — password manager)

- **Upstream**: https://github.com/bitwarden/android.git, pinned tag
  `v2026.7.1-bwpm`. The repo also ships `-bwa` tags (Bitwarden
  Authenticator) — a **different app**, never use those. Module `app`
  (applicationId `com.x8bit.bitwarden` upstream) is the password manager;
  module `authenticator` is the other product and is not touched.
- **App id**: `com.diegonmarcos.cloudvault` (patched from `com.x8bit.bitwarden`)
- **Tracker**: `../ac_upstreams-sources/vault-bitwarden/` (gitignored;
  `materialize-fork` clones it at the pin and never trusts a pre-existing
  tracker HEAD)
- **Flavor**: `fdroid` (dimension `mode`) — the Google-free flavor.
  Firebase/Crashlytics/ML-Kit/Play-Billing are `standardImplementation`-only;
  fdroid ships no-op source-set overrides and disables the
  GoogleServices/Crashlytics gradle tasks in `afterEvaluate`.
- **License**: the SDK crates (`com.bitwarden:sdk-android`, built from
  `crates/bitwarden-uniffi` in bitwarden/sdk-sm) are dual-licensed
  `GPL-3.0-only OR LicenseRef-Bitwarden-SDK`. We elect **GPL-3.0-only** (no
  `bitwarden_license` directory exists under `crates/bitwarden-uniffi`, so
  the commercial grant doesn't apply here anyway). Upstream's `LICENSE.txt`
  is kept intact. See `patches/0003-*` (NOTICE.md) for the full statement.
  Bitwarden trademarks are **not** used — see the rebrand patch.

### Fork machinery

Same engine ac_cloud-mail uses, ported verbatim into this app's `build.sh`
(`_fork_json`, `step_materialize_fork`, `step_build_fork` + their signing/
identity-assert/upstream-apk helpers): clone upstream at the pinned tag into
the gitignored tracker dir, apply the committed `patches/*.patch` series with
`git am`. Same input → same working tree, always — never a long-lived
divergent clone.

```
./build.sh materialize-fork vault   # clone @ pin + apply patches/
./build.sh build-fork vault         # fork's own gradlew :app:assembleFdroidRelease
```

### Patch series (`patches/`)

1. `0001-vault-rebrand-...patch` — `app_name` → "Cloud Vault" in the three
   buildType-scoped `strings_non_localized.xml` (main/beta/release);
   `applicationId` → `com.diegonmarcos.cloudvault`; launcher icon replaced
   with an original padlock mark (main **and** release **and** beta
   drawable overrides — AGP merges the buildType-specific
   `ic_launcher_foreground`/`ic_launcher_monochrome` over main's, so all
   three needed patching for the actual `fdroid`+`release` build to stop
   shipping Bitwarden's shield artwork).
2. `0002-vault-pre-provision-...patch` — first-run default environment
   changed from `Environment.Prod.Us` (Bitwarden's hosted cloud) to
   `Environment.SelfHosted(base = "https://vault.diegonmarcos.com")`.
3. `0003-vault-add-NOTICE-...patch` — adds `NOTICE.md` (GPL-3.0 election,
   trademark disclaimer, fork provenance). Upstream's `LICENSE.txt` is left
   untouched by all three patches.

All three apply cleanly (`git am`, zero fuzz) to a fresh checkout of the
pinned tag — verified in this session.

### Build status: UNVERIFIED

`com.bitwarden:sdk-android` resolves from
`https://maven.pkg.github.com/bitwarden/sdk`, which returns **401 without an
authenticated GitHub token** — even for public artifacts. No token available
in this environment works there, so **the gradle build itself has not been
run/verified**. `settings.gradle.kts` reads the credential as:

```kotlin
password = userProperties["gitHubToken"] as String? ?: System.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
```
(`username` is hardcoded to `""`). CI must export `GITHUB_TOKEN` from a
secret — documented as **`BITWARDEN_PACKAGES_TOKEN`** — before invoking
`build.sh build-fork vault` (a PAT/fine-grained token with `read:packages`
on `bitwarden/sdk`; the default per-run `GITHUB_TOKEN` GitHub Actions mints
is scoped to this repo only and cannot read a different owner's packages).
The first CI run with that secret set is the real test of `build-fork vault`.
